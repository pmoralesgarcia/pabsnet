  It's been three years since I left Nebraska. Nebraska was the state that saw me grow up. My new home is now living in California.

find the person I've always wanted to become. For many years, I lost control of who I was. All that ambition, all those goals were pushed back.

    Apart from that, the roman minuscule has been our way of writing for hundreds
    of years. What followed were merely fashionable variations, here and there even
    deformations, of the noble basic form, but no improvement whatever. The
    punches of Claude Garamond, cut around 1530 in Paris, are simply unsurpassed in
    their clarity, readability and beauty. Garamond appeared on the scene at a
    time when the occidental book, as an object, cast off its medieval
    ponderousness and took up the form which today is still the best: the slender
    and upright rectangular body, comprising folded sheets stitched or sewn at
    the back, in a cover whose protruding edges protect the trimmed pages.
