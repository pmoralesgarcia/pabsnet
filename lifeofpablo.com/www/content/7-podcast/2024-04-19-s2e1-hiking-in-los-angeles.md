### Transcript
Hey! I'm Pablo Morales and I'm the host of Pablo's Thought Podcast. I enjoy sharing topics of technology, traveling, blogging, the IndieWeb and more. 

Thanks for tuning into season 2 of the podcast! For today's episode, I talk about going on hikes in Los Angeles.

I've gone to Los Angeles a few times since I've moved to California. Los Angeles is a city I enjoy visiting because there is so much to do in every direction. It's such a vibrant part of California. I've visited various neighborhoods or cities of the area such as Silver Lake, Pasadena, Santa Ana, Newport Beach, Downtown and of course, many others. I like the dynamic of the city - minus all of the car traffic. The food scene is great. It was hard not to try everything in my path. The possibilities are endless! Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Sacramento anymore. Corny reference I did there?

Out of all the things I like to do in Los Angeles, hiking is probably number one. For the longest time, I would forget that as a very car dependent city, I didn't associate hiking with Los Angeles. I guess one can go on a hike anywhere. At least, first thought of Los Angeles, you don't think of hiking as someone who didn't grow up in California.

On the other hand, as a kid I would dream of visiting L.A. and to go on different adventures in the area. I would go on YouTube and watch hiking videos of all places. L.A. always caught my eye. Now, I'm living that dream. Every time I visit Los Angeles, It is obligatory that I go on a hike for my own pleasure and health.


I enjoy making new friends.
