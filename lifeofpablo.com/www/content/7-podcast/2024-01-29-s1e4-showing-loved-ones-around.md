### Transcript

Welcome to Pabloâ€™s Thoughts Podcast hosted by me, Pablo Morales. This is a podcast where I share the things that are interesting to me such as technology, blogging, the IndieWeb and more. 

Thanks for tuning into the fourth episode of the podcast! Today's episode talks about becoming comfortable where I live and showing friends near where I live. 

I've been living in California for three years now. In these three years, I've covered a lot of ground on places visited in the state. I've been as far north as Chico to as far south as San Diego. I live in Sacramento, which is in Northern California. I'm close to Napa, you know? Wine country, San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, snowboarding, the mountains, hiking and lots of agriculture not too far from me. Wandering around has been beneficial for me but it has also prepared me to show friends and family the area where I live.

It's also noted I am no expert on the region. And much less the State of California. Simply, that "I'm new here!" feeling is slowly going away. I can confidently show visitors where they should go.

I live in Downtown Sacramento and I would consider myself comfortable with knowing places and activities near and around the Sacramento area. I also [travel/go to San Francisco](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/train-rides-and-trader-joes) all the time. I feel that I know the city pretty well enough to wander off to different places. I'm not a native but I feel comfortable knowing where I can get from point A to point B. I'm very fortunate to have friends in San Francisco who encourage me to visit all the time.


Here's an example:   
I'm showing my colleagues' brother, Rami around Northern California since he's visiting from Lebanon. Such a cool down to earth guy! He is eager to make the best of it while staying in Sacramento. We've done so many outdoor activities. We've gone to the mountains or we've gone hiking on a trail. We've been all around the San Francisco Bay area. I feel comfortable and confident walking around in San Francisco and planning out our days here. It's been a blast making sure he feels at home. I've felt that I've been a good tour guide. We're both dudes who are young and like to have fun. So we like to go out! We like to hit concerts and go to the club to catch a drink. He's never had Mexican food, so I took him to a delicious place in the Mission District. (Later, I took him to a couple places in Sacramento.) That makes it easy to keep our minds open and try new experiences. 


When friends and family come to visit, I don't mind doing all the touristy things again especially when friends or family come to visit. It's good to revisit them. I get to help people experience the city the way I did or at least provide that feeling of novelty. We're here for a good time and not a long boring life.
