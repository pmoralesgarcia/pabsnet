This is part of a three or four part blog series. These posts will be interactive on my website ([https://lifeofpablo.com](https://lifeofpablo.com)) . I am in the process of rebuilding my website so stay tuned.

We're here in Korea learning about the culture and language. We meet so many people in our time here. Let's step back a bit and look at the people we have met in our past. I really enjoy the friendships I have made over the years. Some friends I have made visit the United States for a short period of time and return home. Some friends who are from back home in the United States have also left the country to do other things. 

I have met up with two of my friends who I haven’t seen in a few years. It is super great to see them. It is a time where we share culture, memories and reaffirming our friendships.

My Korean Friend - Hyungseok Choi (Derick)

This is my friend Hyungseok. He was an exchange student when I was attending the University of Nebraska at Kearney. I met him through a friend of mine and we started to all hangout.He is such a cool guy. It was a sad day when he returned to his home in South Korea. I was worried I wouldn’t see him again due to the distance and not knowing when I’d go to South Korea. I told him about this trip to South Korea when I initially was selected. We were both excited to see each other. The pandemic kept putting those plans on hold for a few years. Eventually, I’d make it to Korea and tell him I arrived. It was so great to see him. I learned so much from Hyungseok. He taught me so much about Korean Culture, Korean Cuisine,perspectives on life and more. It is great that I can have a friend in a country I have never been to and who understands the complexities.

My American Friend - Emily Hemmer

Me and Emily both went to the University of Nebraska at Kearney. We both studied abroad in Europe at the same time. She is currently teaching English in South Korea. She has always been someone who is passionate about other cultures and not afraid to try new things. It’s been great seeing her in South Korea. I really appreciate her giving me insight on teaching in Korea and living in Korea. I enjoyed her talking about culture and the exchange of ideas we’ve had. She's been telling me about all the concerts and events she has attended. I’m so jealous! She recently went to a K-Pop concert.

Overall, keeping friendships is important to grow as a person but also keep you culturally understanding of the world.
