*Three friends hanging out*

Back in Elementary, I was in this friend group who enjoyed music. This must have been in 2009? (That was a long time ago!) When you're a kid, you slowly discover music that you enjoy and not enjoy. What better way than to expose yourself to other individual's tastes in music?  I would hang out with Abraham and Luke. I'd say, they influenced who I am as a person and the direction of my musical tastes. 

Abraham grew up in Colombia and moved out to my hometown in Nebraska. Luke grew up in Hawaii and had moved to Nebraska a year before. Both Luke and Abraham played the guitar. I was super excited to have friends who had come from cool places!

I was the only one who didn't play the guitar, much less have a passion for playing an instrument. My friends at the time still took me in and accepted me into the group. It was super duper to watch live shows in my friend's basement. They used to play covers of Subline, Linkin Park, and Bullet for My Valentine.

At that time frame, I was very interested in photography and videography. I always carried my Sony Cyber-Shot with me because you never know when you would need to get that cool shot. You're probably thinking, "That's some lame point in shoot!" When your parents buy you a camera, you have to work with what you got! A camera is a camera!

**Question time!**

Can you guess which role did I play in my friend group? If you guessed the camera guy, you win a cookie! Do you like internet cookies? I don't know how to share a real cookie via the internet. 

I would record their guitar sessions on my camera. It was a pretty cool experience getting blasted with hardcore metal while figuring out the best way of recording! I learned important fundamentals of video recording. I focused on stabilizing the camera, considering lighting, and audio clipping (which I had no control over). Not only was I enjoying myself but also I learned a lot. 

One of my favorite memories when we weren't in Luke's basement was walking to get pizza. Living in a small town, things are relatively within walking distance. 

As time went on friends came and went. We all went our different paths even though we lived in the same hometown for years. I am thankful to have hung with these guys for a few years. I hope these guys are happy and living fulfilling lives. 

Here are a few videos that I recorded.
