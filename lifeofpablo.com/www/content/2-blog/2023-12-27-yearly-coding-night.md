Tonight will be a fun and exciting night. We're closing out the year by having a hackatron coding night with my friends. Just a bunch of dudes in a room coding the night away. We will be working on a game and our personal projects. There will be of snacks, lots of laughs, throwbacks and more. We all help each other out. We all live in different parts of the country but during the holidays we are back in our hometowns in Nebraska. It's always good to back with the lads and to reconnect and share what we have been working on. I love these guys. I'm going to continue to work on an IndieAuth project at some point but the focus of tonight will be a game or however the night takes us.  

See you all in the wee hours of the morning.
