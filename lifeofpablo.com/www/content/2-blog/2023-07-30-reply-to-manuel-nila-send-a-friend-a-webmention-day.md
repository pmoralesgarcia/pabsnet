## Happy Send a Friend Webmention Day and International Friend Day!

   Dear Mani,

   I wanted to send you your first Webmention on the perfect day! I am so happy that we are friends! I want to thank you for all the help you have given me with becoming more up to speed what’s happening with technology.  You are the coolest person around! And you don’t know how much I appreciate you! 
   I am also excited that you got your website implemented with the indieauth spec/implementation. Now you can sign into different people’s sites and receive annoying webmentions from me! ✉️

   I can’t wait to go on a trip with you soon!

   With Love,
   Pablo
