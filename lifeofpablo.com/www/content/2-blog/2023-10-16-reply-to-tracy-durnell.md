Thank you for taking me up on what you're reading! I really enjoyed your books and I will check them out! The book, *belonging by bell hooks* really caught my eye. 

You wrote in your post, 

> Iâ€™m totally an out of sight out of mind person

I'm the same way too. If it's not in my face or I don't see it laying around the apartment, I wont read it.  have attempted various efforts to read on devices in the past without much success. 

I've always like being able to feel the textures of the book I'm reading at the moment. I'm going to attempt to read more effectively by reading in chunks and slowly increase the time. 

Go Libraries!

Thank you again for the response!
