Topic of today is music.  Importantly bands!  As some of you may know, I went to the Vans Warped Tour '15 and discovered a lot of bands.  It was probably the best day of my life so far!

I want to introduce you guys to a band I discovered this summer: BoyMeetsWorld.   A band of five guys from Ohio.

They are a really good rock/alternative band.  For my die-hard alternative fans.  This band is for you!! Those who want to expand their music taste, I also encourage you to listen to them.  I really like their music.  I can really relate to them.

-According to Vans Warped Tour Site</blockquote>

These are one of the nicest guys you will ever meet!  One can really relate to their music!  They never disappoint their growing fan base. Thanks guys for autographing my stuff.  This was definitely put in the books.

It is nice to see a band grow and see them be even more successful as time goes on!  I see great things for you guys!
