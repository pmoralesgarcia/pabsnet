Hello, I'm Pablo Morales from Sacramento, California! I'm a participant in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). 

What is the IndieWeb?

> The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the “corporate web”.
> 
> It is a community of independent and personal websites connected by open standards and based on the principles of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning your content. 

I am volunteering to host and organize the first [IndieWebCamp Sacramento](https://indieweb.org/Planning#Sacramento,_CA) (IWC).  It is a great way to bring together your local IndieWeb community and people from the greater IndieWeb community. As the pandemic changed how we interact, online meet-ups have kept the IndieWeb going. It would be nice to meet many of the familiar faces we've seen through the last few years in person!

[Organizing](https://indieweb.org/IndieWebCamp_Organizing) and planning an IndieWebCamp in person involves various parts such as finding co-organizers, planning where to have the event, and the many aspects of event planning. 

I'm looking for a co-host or co-host. A co-host would be someone who could assist me in planning for a successful event. It can be someone local near Sacramento or someone who can assist remotely. Having a co-host would help in making the event come to fruition and have the event be successful.


IWC Dates:  
The new plan is to host it during the fall or winter when the weather starts cooling off!

* Late September
* October
* November
* December


If you or someone else is interested in helping plan IndieWebCamp Sacramento, I'd love to have you! Send me an email by <a href="mailto:pablo@lifeofpablo.com?subject=IWC Sacramento Co-Hosting">clicking here</a>.

Let's have this last half of the year be full of fun events and one of those can be in Sacramento! If you are interested in attending, more information will be available soon!

Anyone and everyone is welcome to participate in the IndieWeb.
