I really enjoy your perspective Sara. It's very eye opening but I see some commonalities. 

Even though I don't go to the movies often, I will find myself going to the indie movie theater instead of seeing a mainstream movie theater. Really learning how to do things alone is a challenge in itself.


I'm starting to discover who I want to be as a person but there are some things I need to change and not get too comfortble either. It's a battle.
