I'm really excited to share that I applied to the graduate program at the alma mater I graduated from at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. I applied for the Masters of Science in Education in Learning, Design & Technology with an Information Technology Concentration. I chose the IT concentration because, I work in IT where I would like to implement my knowledge at the school level. I'm not in the classroom as often anymore. It seemed more appropriate to go this route.

I'm really excited to go back to school! I've been itching for this for a while. Since, I still work in education, it seems appropriate to also continue my education and better improve my knowledge and skills in addition to what I do already with other forms of learning. 

I also value education as well. I want to also have degrees beyond a bachelor's degree. My goal in the near but possibly distance future is to get a doctorate degree. Even with a master's degree, it's been a dream to teach a course or two at the university level. I would teach technology courses specifically for teachers to help eliminate barriers and increase technology literacy for teachers. I would also teach methods for teachers of all ages through scaffolding to embrace technology.

As a Latino, I find it important to help represent that we can succeed in higher education. 

Time to register for classes!
