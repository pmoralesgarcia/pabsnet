Iâ€™ve been thinking about my first students I had as a first-year middle school French teacher. I remember when they first walked into my classroom and I said, "Bonjour" while giving them a high-five! From their first day in seventh grade to their eighth-grade promotion. I was very fortunate to teach them.

Look at them now! They just recently graduated from high school. It brings me joy!  They were just kids, and now they are adults going off to the next stage of their lives. I want you all to do great things. 

The real question here is, did you keep up with your French? 

I hope we cross paths once again. 

With Love,
Monsieur Morales.
