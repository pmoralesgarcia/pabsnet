So who is freezing their but off? That would be me! Well we can say that winter has officially kicked in, so has the break. So it is the time to throw your shoes and load up that good ol' Netflix account. We all need to catch up on the shows that we have abandoned lately.

It has been a while since I wrote last. Let me tell you, it has been a quite the interesting semester.I stayed busy with all my activities especially with my fraternity. I'm a now an initiated member ofÂ  Alpha Tau Omega. Being part of Greek life, it has opened me many doors. On my free time, I've been working out a lot lately. Since the beginning of the school year, I managed to lose over 20 pounds. What a difference it has made! I feel great. I want to thank my workout buddy for helping me out!! Props to you man for putting up with me!

All my finals went well. Let's say that I was not myself during dead week. Maybe I can make a zombie reference?? I passed all my tests and ended on a well note for the semester. There is always room for improvement.

The first day back was just filled with a lot of things to do and with a lot of surprises. Good things after another occurred.

It feels great hanging out with my family. I've missed them so much. While back in the dorm, it seemed that I really did not missed them much. Once I got home, I realized how much they were truly a missing part of me. I missed my mom's home cooked meals. What a relief that I can stay away from the cafeteria food.

Then I went to my high school to see the varsity basketball game. Go Tigers!! They kicked some ass when they beat York 65-38. The game was intense. How I miss the basketball games. Once a tiger always a tiger! It was great seeing some old friends.

I am glad to have made many friends this semester. I appreciate everyone of you. Let's see what is in stock for us this coming semester.

Happy Holidays everyone!! Stay warm and make a snowman (if we can get enough snow.)"
