It's currently 1 am in Nebraska. I got bored, so I asked ChatGPT the following question.
> Hello! Can you provide me 100 questions to learn more about people? Deeper level questions.

I've been thinking about asking people different questions. These can be random people, family members, friends, colleagues, etc. I'm more of a listener. 

I also thought why not ask myself (or others) these questions and write about it. So instead of waiting for the New Year to start a new habit. Why not start now? I haven't blogged as much lately so this will incentivize me!

I will find a way to answer these questions. I will do my best to do it in order but I'm okay with jumping around!

100 Questions in 100 Days! Let's begin!

Would you like to help me answer some of these questions? Please email me at [pablo [at] lifeofpablo.com](mailto:pablo@lifeofpablo.com) or send me a webmention! Make sure to tell me which question you'd like to discuss!
