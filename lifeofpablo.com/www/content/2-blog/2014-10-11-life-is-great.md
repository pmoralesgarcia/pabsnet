Hello friends and family!! I have not written in a while. It has been a busy month and few weeks. School has been great!

Making new friends has been one of the best experiences so far. I have made even more friends as the days have gone by. I have got to know my suite-mates so much since we landed foot on campus. We do a lot of stuff together. Example such as eating breakfast or going out for a midnight snack. Who doesn't like a late McDonald's run. (Especially me since I get a discount for working there :) )  I have been working out a lot with my suite mate. We go almost everyday. It helps I know I can rely on them for anything, as well as they can rely on me for anything. We've experience ups and down.  If I didn't get the opportunity to live in the dorms, who knows if I would of ever met these great people. I'm glad that I made the right choice

There have been so many events on campus it is hard to remember all of them. One of my favorite was the campus scavenger hunt. The purpose of the scavenger hunt was to familiarize and get to the know campus in a competitive way. Another of my favorite events was riding on a float for my fraternity ATΩ. The the theme of homecoming / our float was Blue and Gold Rock N Roll. The float had Zed Zeppelin but for his head it had Louie the Loper. It was a  great way to bond with my fraternity brothers.

Then of course, those who know me how involved I was in high school. Well this is no different here being in college. I am a CAN officer for my building. I am involved with the Office of Multicultural Affairs, specifically in Hispanic Student Association (HSA)  and Young Arab Leaders Association (YALA.) One of the most things I enjoy doing is volunteering for the Nebraska Aids Project here in Kearney. I enjoy helping people who are struggling with HIV/AIDS. Spreading awareness about HIV/AIDS has always been something I have enjoyed since high school

So I am forward to this weekend. I am having a reunion with the World Leaders Camp that I attended this summer. I'm excited to see how everyone is doing. Want to know more about my experience?? <a title=""Day 1 – UNK World Leaders Camp"" href=""http://pabs.altervista.org/blog/2014/07/22/day-1-unk-world-leaders-camp/"" target=""_blank"">click here!</a> (Will open new tab or window).

That is all for now. I'll post more often as I can.
