"Hello Everyone!!
Well the time has come. I'm all packed up (I think) and I will be moving away to college. It seems like yesterday that I was starting freshman year of  high school. It went through my mind thinking if I will be able to survive the next four years? Luckily I did. :) The next chapter of my life has begun. I I hope that I will graduate college in four years or less. I will really miss everyone that I have met along the way. Anyone from helping me pick my books up in the hall way, that person that was always there for me when I was down or even the person that would join me on a great adventure. All these memories just roaming around in my head. I guess I wont be that far from home?? I'm ready to start even more memories. I am excited to be around new people. I really want to find out who I really am to get to know myself even more. It is a weird thing to say.

This will be the last time I will sleep in my own bed for a long time. It will be strange not being in the house I grew up in my whole life. There will be no home cook meals ready when I'm done with classes. It will be hard to get used to. My goal is not to get homesick (I will eventually). Like I said I am not going away that far (45 mins.) It is time for me to be more independent of myself. Mom will not be there to hold our hands in college. I will have to make decisions that will guide my daily life and those that will affect me for the rest of my life.

There are so many people I want to say goodbye to but time has not allowed me. If anyone wants to see me, let me know.

Cannot wait for what is ahead.

Wish me luck!!!

EDIT: I will also keep updated on social media and make a blog post when I am all moved in."
