I was roaming around giving myself the tour of the house that we live in. I started at the bottom and made my way to the roof. I noticed  something I wasn't expecting, a solar power water heater. I didn't know that solar water heater was installed. It works so nicely and it is environmentally friendly. I don't have to worry about using a liquid propane or gas heater to heat the water.
