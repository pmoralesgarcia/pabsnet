"Hey guys! Pablo here!

Wondering if I was still alive or not? Well here I am. I made it through the first week of college. Since the minute I stepped foot outside my car I knew I was going to enjoy it. Most of it, minus the move in day process.

&nbsp;

I got to see my good friend Lucas, who just came back from Brazil to come study here at UNK. Man I missed this guy. He is my roommate that I will be staying with all year long. I just hope we don't kill each by then. So far we are getting along great.

Later that morning I got to meet my suite mates: Thomas and Riley. These two are from around North Platte, NE. Who knew we would all be alike? We are all like brothers from another mother. They've made the week great.I wish I would have met them earlier!

Since we are now bros, we have done many fun activities. Activities like working out or even just walking around (towards the cafeteria of course :) )

The first weekend of college was great. There were a lot of fun activities. There was a lot of free food and free stuff!! I got a free stylus for my touch screen computer. That was the highlight of my free stuff shopping spree. I really wanted the free iPad. Oh Well.

Who doesn't like free stuff?? I know I do!

I have made many friends so far. I am glad to see many of my friends that I went to school or that I knew especially from the World Leaders Camp.

People on my floor are amazing. I've met people from Italy to Venezuela. I enjoy being on such a diverse campus where people immerse you in their culture. This will really want me to study abroad.

There have been some funny moments on my floor. Like this one kid who danced to anaconda
