Description: Just my thoughts on this day
---
Mom made me breakfast. I had to work for a good part of the day. It was a decent day. A job is a job. Work keeps to me busy from worrying about things in my life. I went for another run today. It is very relaxing. Been Snap chatting Thomas, looks like he's having a great time in his town...not really. I just realized how boring my spring break is going. Maybe next year I'll go to the beach to California or something. I really want to have a true college spring break. It was a decent day today. I did not think of anything bad. I should do my homework that I have been procrastinating.
