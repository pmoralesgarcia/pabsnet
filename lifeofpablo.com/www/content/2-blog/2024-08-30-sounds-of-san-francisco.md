*This is an interactive post featuring audio*

I love San Francisco. It is unique with different sounds. You never know what you're going to hear around you! It could be someone who is having a great or someone who isn't doing so well. Sound provides an identity of a city. I've noticed some patterns or sounds I only tend to find here.

Something I enjoy doing is recording the sounds of San Francisco. It could be as simple as recording near Powell Station or the Mission district. These sounds were recorded using an iPhone 12.

Here is a small sample of sounds. Enjoy!

  <summary>Bluegrass Concert - Click to Expand!</summary>

One of my good friends plays the banjo. He's a great banjo player. If you like bluegrass he's the person to talk to!

Bluegrass was foreign to me until my friend taught me so much about it.

  <summary>Taking the MUNI- Click to Expand!</summary>
I really, really enjoy taking public transportation. Not only is it better for traffic, and reduces pollution. The MUNI (and BART) stations are great places to get some audio recordings. It feels great to have for San Francisco and the uniqueness of its underground tunnels.

  <summary>Public Conversation - Click to Expand!</summary>
Wherever I turn,  I hear conversations ranging from, "What are we having for lunch?" to "Let's go to grab a drink!" It's nice to hear people talking and enjoying each other's company through conversations in public spaces such as buses, on the street or simply sitting down on a bench.

  <summary>Street - Click to Expand!</summary>

There's something so beautiful about hearing the background sounds of cars, people walking, bikes, the wind, etc. Growing up it was very quiet growing up in a small midwest town. I enjoy the "naturally" occurring city street sounds.
