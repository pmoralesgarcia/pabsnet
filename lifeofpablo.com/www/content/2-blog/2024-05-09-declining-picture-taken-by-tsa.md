Today, I'm flying out of San Francisco (SFO) and I experienced something new today. For the first time, I was asked to have my picture taken by the *Transportation Security Administration*, or commonly known as the *TSA*. I'm not surprised that an airport such as San Francisco would have these implemented as ways of efficiently getting passengers as fast as possible. 

I politely told the TSA agent that I am declining facial recognition. The agent simply conducted a manual document check. It was a very easy experience and the TSA agent was very respectful.

The point here is that you're not required or obligated to have your picture taken for biometric verification in the **United States**. You can simply opt-out by requesting so at a point of entry, such as airport customs and of course with the TSA. Your identity document(s) is verified through a manual check.

I wrote a post, *[Why I Opted-Out of Facial Recognition at Customs and Border Patrol
](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/why-i-opted-out-of-facial-recognition-at-customs-and-border-patrol)* on opting out of facial recognition by the United States Customs and Border Patrol and the experience I had.

Many people don't know they can decline or aren't aware of the risks that facial recognition have in our society. People need to be more aware of their rights when it comes to biometrics and the data retention of such biometrics.
