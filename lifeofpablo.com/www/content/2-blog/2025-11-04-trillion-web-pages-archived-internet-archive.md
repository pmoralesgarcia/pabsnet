It happened! Hooray! [1 Trillion Pages Archived](https://blog.archive.org/2025/10/31/one-trillion-web-pages-archived-internet-archive-celebrates-a-civilization-scale-milestone/) at the Internet Archive! What an amazing time to celebrate the preservation of internet history!

A few weeks ago, I was very fortunate to attend a celebration at the Internet Archive! It was an amazing experience! I'm so happy I got a ticket! 

What an amazing time to celebrate this milestone in human history. There were many appearances from people past and present at the Internet Archive. I finally got to see Brewster Kahle in the flesh. He's the founder and digital librarian of the Internet Archive.
California State Senator Scott Weiner of Senate District 11 made an appearance and received an award!

The mood was great! People were cheering, dancing, screaming, and all in between! I was dancing around! 

I'm very happy that the Internet Archive gives me hope for the internet. The current state of the internet is sad.
