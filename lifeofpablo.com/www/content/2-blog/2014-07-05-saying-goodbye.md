So this week the last foreign exchange student left Hastings to go back to his home country. It was sad seeing him leave.

It is fun meeting new people. Not everyday does a person get to meet a lot of foreign people especially here in Small Town, Nebraska. This especially students around our own age. Hastings High had a total of 6 foreign exchange students from many different nationalities most of which came from Europe and one from South America. Coming here was a new complete experience for all of them.

It was fun meeting all the foreign exchange students this year. You guys really helped me become a more open minded person to become more indulged with diversity. I learned a lot about myself. Thanks for all the great experiences. This will be one of the fondest memories of high school that I will be able to look back on.

It was fun meeting all the foreign exchange students this year. I want to to apologize to the ones that I did not say goodbye :( .I wish I could of been there.

<blockquote> To all of you guys of this year and years past. THANK YOU. I will see you guys in the future. Best of luck!</blockquote>
