This past month has been hard for many reasons. I've been trying to find better outlets to not take away my attention from what's happening in the world but a way to find a bit of peace and focus on thing that do matter. It's important to not ignore things but to find a balance. We need a break from the direct and indirect stressors of life. 

I've been trying to do more learning and enjoying myself.

One of the things I've been working on has been reading more books. I'm trying to learn on fixing my attention span from the over usage of cell phone usage.


**Here are some of the books I am currently reading:**

Boy Slut - Zachary Zane 

El Camino - Miguel Delibes 

David Bowie Made Me Gay - Darryl W. Bullock

Desertores - Paola Ramos
