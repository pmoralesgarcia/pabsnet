I am sharing that I am moving to San Francisco this week! I've accepted a new job out there and I'm so stoked! It still hasn't hit me that I'm moving to a different part of California.

My career path will be to continue working in IT but leaving education. Education will always have a special place in my heart. I'm excited about the new path for my career and acquiring some new skills! Being a nerd is fun! 

San Francisco and the Bay Area are such places of beauty. I've dreamt of living in a city like this one since I was a kid. I've traveled and stayed in places throughout the world for extended periods but there's nothing like being in a place you'll be at for a long time.

Why San Francisco other than your new job, Pablo? Yes, thank you for asking! I'd love to answer your question! 

Let me tell you that I'm curious and I like to wander off to other places. Wandering off to different parts of California is no exception. While living in Sacramento, I would hop on the [train](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/train-rides-and-trader-joes) on holiday breaks and weekends to San Francisco. Who doesn't like taking a train? I have friends that I visit quite regularly. I know my way around the city. They would show me around but also I would go off on my adventure. Do you see a pattern here? I'm excited to see my friends who live down the street or across town. I won't need to travel two hours or more to get there.

I'll be close to outdoor adventures, go to my favorite [hackerspace](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge) and more! 

San Francisco is a place where I want to continue to flourish as an individual. I'm just getting started! It will grow my career, my lifestyle choices, my health, increased network opportunities, my love for technology, and my love for public transit. I've learned so much about myself being in the city. Now that I get to live there, I will continue to learn more! Don't forget about walking everywhere as well!

I'm excited to be working on some startup ideas in my downtime. 

I can't wait for my friends, and family to visit me! San Francisco is easy to fly into! For my Nebraska people, Interstate 80 will take you to me! You can't miss it unless you drive into the bay. Isn't there a scene like this in *[The Office](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOW_kPzY_JY)*?


I still find it hard to believe that this guy from Hastings, Nebraska has made it to San Francisco! I'm going to be living in a major city! The initial idea of moving to California seemed out of this world! Moving to San Francisco takes the cake! I don't regret venturing out of Nebraska. I'm more happy than I've ever been. This is your sign to explore other parts as well. You won't regret it!

I'm sad I'm leaving Sacramento. It received me with open arms and I am extremely grateful for the people I have me. Every single one of you has had an impact on me. 

To my friend on the other side of the country, I'll be waving while you drink some tea!
