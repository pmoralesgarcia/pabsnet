Today I am attending IndieWeb Create Day to create something today for my website. I want to build an extension for [Datenstrom](https://datenstrom.se), a flat-file CMS I currently use for my [website](https://lifeofpablo.com/). 

The extension I'm starting to build today is an Extension which would introduce the [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/) Specification. I would like to get pretty advanced with it but for now I want to implement the basics of the specification. Just to get it "working." I will build this using PHP which is the language the CMS and the extensions are built on. 

I will post an update on any progress I get.
