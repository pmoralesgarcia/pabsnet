            Growing up in the Midwest I used to complain about the snow. Now that I am far from it, I do realize it's my kind of weather.

         <div class="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns black-70 baskerville" markdown="1">
            Growing up in the Midwestern region of the United States (or commonly known as the Midwest) I was so used to irritable weather. What I mean by irritable weather was facing, "four seasons in one week." You're probably thinking the following: "How is this possible?" It simply does! If you know, you know. 
            Here are a few examples (No particular order)
            <section class="fl w-100 br1">
               <div class="fl w-100 w-50-m w-25-l pa3-m pa4-l">
                  <div class="f4 lh-copy measure" markdown="1">
                     <i class="fa-solid fa-leaf green"></i> 

                     One day it can be a nice spring day with all the flowers blooming being happy as can be.
                  </div>
               </div>
               <div class="fl w-100 w-50-m w-25-l pa3-m pa4-l">
                  <div class="f4 lh-copy measure" markdown="1">
                     <i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake light-blue f3"></i> 

                     The following day you could wake up to find out that there is a blizzard in effect. 
                  </div>
               </div>
               <div class="fl w-100 w-50-m w-25-l pa3-m pa4-l">
                  <div class="f4 lh-copy measure" markdown="1">
                     <i class="fa-solid fa-sun orange"></i>

                     A few days, it could be scorching hot and wondering how we got here?
                  </div>
               </div>
               <div class="fl w-100 w-50-m w-25-l pa3-m pa4-l">
                  <div class="f4 lh-copy measure" markdown="1">
                     <i class="fa-solid fa-tree light-purple"></i>

                     The last few days of the week, it could be a beautiful, soothing fall day and you forget about the weather tragedies of earlier of the week.

            As chaotic as it sounds, I do miss it. I do miss sometimes not knowing if I will melt one day or be trapped in my home for many days at a time.  My favorite is knowing if my home would fly away in a tornado. As silly and boring the topic of weather is, it is also a bonding activity with people who live in this region. It's almost a pastime knowing we could just die at any minute. 

            If I were to pick a favorite season, it would be winter. Are you in shock? Even I don't believe it. I do miss dressing up all nice for the winter. Who doesn't like wearing cute winter outfits. If were going to suffer in the cold we might as well look our best! 

            I moved to California to live in a different place and subconsciously to escape the cold. In Northern California it is generally just hot here all the time. I do miss having season changes. Geography and location tends to influence the type of weather or climate one lives in.

You can take the person out of the midwest but you can't take the Midwestern out of the person.
