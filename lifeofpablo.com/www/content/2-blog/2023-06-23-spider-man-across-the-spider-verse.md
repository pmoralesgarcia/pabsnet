I have an entire backlog of movies to watch. Yes, I apparently live under a rock. I made sure Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse didn't fall into this black whole.  

I'm not going to share any spoilers. I'll try at least. The movie was amazing. I really enjoyed every second of the movie, It was jam packed! So much action, so much emotion, and so many realizations. It's cool to connect the dots from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, whether or not it was intentional. 

There were so many plot twists. So many ways things can go. You know the Spider-Verse.....? Thanks for inviting me Lisa and Luke. 

It made me think about many of the decisions I made in life. It's insane how many of my memories growing up ran across. I had a few tears and emotions in the scenes between Miles and his mom. She reminded me about my mom and the close relationship I have with her. My mom is such an amazing person.  I also had so many tears and emotions when I saw the interactions between Miles and his dad. My dad is also an amazing person as well. We are also close. Lot's of emotions and tears as well. It reminded me about what it was like to grow up Latino. Obviously, my experience is different but I see many shared experiences of some level. 

There were many funny scenes that I was rolling over. Sorry neighbor. The funniest scenes were the ones that were subtle. 


I can't wait to see the next one that will come out, I will probably re watch the entire two movies again and more. 

I want to write more but I don't want to give spoilers.
