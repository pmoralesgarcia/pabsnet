Today was a great first day at [Greentech Festival](https://greentechfestival.com/) in Berlin! This is my first time attending a conference with a booth and all. It was such a great experience. We are showcasing a game we made for the conference in Berlin. So far I've met so many amazing people who demoed the game. We learned so much from others who were at the conference. Networking was off the charts and made some good relationships with the booths around us! I'm so happy I took time off to come back to this amazing city. Here comes day 2! So stoked to continue showcasing this adventure!

The game we are currently working on is called [*Wasted Space*](https://wastedspace.fun/). Here is a description from the website.
> Wasted Space is a classic arcade game that drives home the idea of reusing and recycling. Fly a spaceship through endless enemies and collect metal from destroyed ships in order to upgrade your own!

I attended with [Sammy Harper](https://www.sammyharper.com/) who founded [Terrabyte](https://www.terrabyte.eco/).  Definitely out his personal website and the Terrabyte website.
