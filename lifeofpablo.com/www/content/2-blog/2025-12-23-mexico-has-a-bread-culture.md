I remember, as a kid, spending summers, holidays, or extended periods of time in Oaxaca, where I would eat the most delicious breads. There are breads I can only get in Oaxaca. It's fascinating how bread can vary from town to town. 

Mexico has a delicious bread culture.

I don't appreciate it when someone disses the Mexican cuisine, and especially on Mexican bread, due to not knowing the history, lack of awareness, and most likely ignorance.  It's important to respect the cultural cuisine.
