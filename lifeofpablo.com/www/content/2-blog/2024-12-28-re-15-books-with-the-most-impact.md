[Tracy](https://tracydurnell.com/) nominated me a while ago (more like July) to share my [list(s) of books](https://tracydurnell.com/2024/07/10/re-15-books-with-the-most-impact/) that have impacted me. Reiterating what Tracy wrote, many of these books had their moment with me and others still hold strong to me. 

*I won't go too in-depth for some of these for various reasons. I also don't wan't to give too many spoilers.*

### Books:

**A Thousand Splendid Suns** - Khaled Hosseini

**Maus / Maus II - Art Spiegelman**

* A graphic novel where Spiegelman interviews his father about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor.
*I really enjoyed the various themes in the book.
* This is a must read

**1984** - George Orwell

* This taught me many lessons and how eerie this period of time is currently. I'm pretty scared for what's to come.

**The Odyssey** - Homer

* Many of the themes taught me some important lessons.

**In The Hot Zone** - Kevin Sites

* This wasn't my favorite book but it made me aware of various wars and situations happening beyond Iraq.

**Lady of the Lake** - Sir Walter Scott

**Yeruldelgger** - Ian Manook (French)

* This book me realize I can actually read French.

**Ryan White My Own Story** - Ryan White

* Ryan White has always been an inspiration to me as I have in various periods of my life been involved with bringing awareness about HIV/AIDS. It fascinated me how well-versed Ryan was and his outlook on life as he was very unlucky getting the virus from tainted blood products. 

**Le Gone du Chaâba** - Azouz Begag (French)

* Le Gone du Chaâba (The Kid of the Chaaba), translated into English as Shantytown Kid by Naima Wolf. 
* I love this book as it shows the struggles of balancing two different cultures - the country you live in and the culture at home. This book understood me in various ways as I struggled to balance US life and my Mexican culture.
* My French Professor gave me this book as a graduation gift.

**Remaking Manhood: Stories From the Front Lines of Change** - Mark Greene

* I read this book right before I graduated college. Being a male teacher is very important as many students don't have a good male role model at home. I made it a goal in my teaching to help my students not fall for certain behaviors.
* This book also helped me reevaluate my relationships and look deep inside of me.

**Winning the War On War** - Joshua S. Goldstein

* I minored in International Studies and this book really opened me up to deeper issues that continue to exist.

**Constructive Living** - David K. Reynolds

* Although this book wasn't the solution to many of my problems during some very dark times, it has helped me address them and find the right direction. It has helped me get out of the rut.

**Journey To The Future: A Roadmap for Success for Youth** -  Consuelo Castillo Kickbusch (Author)

* This book has helped me in various ways to get where I am today. Consuela is a great presenter!

**The New Koreans: The Story of a Nation** - Michael Breen

* This book opened my eyes and helped me tremendously before my [Korea Trip](/korea).
