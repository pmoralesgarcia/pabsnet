Over the last few months I ditched Spotify as my main subscription music service. Then for a while, I was on Youtube Music which I also left. I didn't mind ads for a while. No biggie, that's what we did pre-adblockers. As I was looking for another service to use, I stumbled upon something I didn't open for a few years.
