* Golden Gate Park
* Went to the skatepark
* Went thrift shopping

## Item Purchased
* I bought some drums, a small notebook and speaker wire at [Community Thrift Store ](https://www.communitythriftsf.org/). Thrifting is fun in San Francisco.

## Learning
* I got a Google Workspace certificate that is part of a Google Admin/Workspace specialization.
* I listened to book writers and illustrators that were invited to speak at work.

## Socializing
* I went to Noisebridge in San Francisco. Noisebridge is a creative technology community for excellent, do-ocratic, consensus-based collaboration. Hackerspace in simple terms but so much more than that. I networked with a lot of people there and possibly working on a new project involving lighting and shows. 

## Exercise
* Got my steps in walking everywhere in San Francisco. Next time I need to bring my running shoes.
* I went on a hike near Lands End Lookout.

## Good News
* I found out I'm going to Berlin in May. I'm going to a climate conference. I started looking at tickets. 

## Meals/Food
* I enjoyed a hamburger from the Amtrak Train. 
* I enjoyed a nice cup of hot matcha tea and miso soup at [Ryoko's Japanese Restaurant & Bar.](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ryokos-san-francisco) 
* I went to [Cozy Cafe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cozy-cafe-san-francisco-2) three times and I ate a Sausage, Egg and Cheese with an everything seasoned bagel.
* I enjoyed some Lousiana Styled fried chicken at [Aramex Restaurant](https://www.yelp.com/biz/aramex-san-francisco) in the Mission.

## Artist Dates
* Hanged out with someone new. :D

## Tech Stuff
* I added a page where I share what music [I'm listening to](/lists/music-listened). I used a mariadb (mysql) database and I built a small web application so I can update it on the fly. I use IndieAuth and Vouch Proxy to help put a wall around it.
