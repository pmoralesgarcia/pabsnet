This past week I returned to my hometown in Nebraska. It was nice to experience all things Nebraska.  

In addition to seeing my parents, I did attend my 10-year graduation. It's weird that high school was 10 years ago. I've changed a lot as a person. Being around people you spent so much time around for most of your adolescence is humbling and remember your roots. It was great to reconnect with so many people. Many of my classmates are married, have kids, and enjoy life. Many stayed close to home while a handful of us moved on to other places outside of Nebraska. 

I enjoyed reconnecting with everyone.
