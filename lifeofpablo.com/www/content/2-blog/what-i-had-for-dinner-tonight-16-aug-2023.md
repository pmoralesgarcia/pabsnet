# Recent Trip
On my most recent trip to Oaxaca I brought back lots of delicious foods with me. One food item that always comes back with me is tlayudas. 
# This is a Tlayuda

A tlayuda is a big tortilla tortilla that is a staple food in Oaxaca made out of corn and water. They are huge and twice the size of my head. These are no regular tortillas. This has been a food I've been eating since I was a young kid with my parents, grandparents, other relatives, and many friends. Even in moments of low funds, I have always been able to rely on these to meet my needs.

Often times the tlayuda itself is the plate which you eat on. What I mean by this that often times you don't use an actual plate on the table to hold your tlayuda but the tlayuda is your plate.

# How It's Eaten?
There are many ways on how you eat one but here are the ways I eat them:

* You rip the tlayuda piece by piece until there is no more 
* You can roll it up and just starting biting into it.

# What's on this Tlayuda
This one is a simple Tlayuda. For the toppings, I used:

* Tlayuda as the base
* Homemade refried beans
* Quesillo (Oaxacan String Cheese)
* Chapulines (Grasshoppers). Yes, you read that correctly.

# Why I Chose These Ingredients
I brought back plenty of these ingredients with me from Oaxaca since I don't get to have these often or it's hard to find around here. Even when i do find them here, it doesn't have the same taste or the ingredients are old. I'm trying to eat as much of them as fast as I can.

I love quesillo. Even though my body I don't agree with dairy much but quesillo is something that I never have a problem with. It probably the way it's cultured. 

I also haven't had much of an appetite the last few days and I haven't been craving much meat either. The chapulines provide me a substantial amount of protein and nutrients. It's common in Oaxaca to go multiple meals without eating meat. There are times where I don't eat meat for weeks at a time

# Keep Connected with My Roots
As a first generation Mexican-American and Oaxacan, food is important to me to help me stay connected with my culture.
