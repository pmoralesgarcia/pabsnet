Today is a holiday celebrated by many. I don't celebrate this holiday. It's simply another day but a more cheerful glee. 

The weather is the 60s and it's sunny out. It's just a beautiful day. The day just wants to pull you outdoors and it wants you to enjoy the simplicity of what is on the outside.I just got back from a run around the park that is nearby me. It was just very nice to see a lot happening at the park. It is very uplifting to see people making use o public spaces. Many groups and families are there simply enjoying their sunday afternoon. There is a group of people dancing to traditional 

Here are the things I saw or heard that made me happy:

* Listening to traditional Mexican music. 
* Mexican folk dances in respect to La Virgin of Guadalupe (The Virgin of Guadalupe). It's nice to see these dances don't get lost as time goes on.
* I saw a group of people putting up banners to protect LGBT rights. These must be protected at all costs!
* I saw families barbecuing and enjoying time together. This reminds me when I lived with my parents.


Enjoy the upbeat Sunday!
