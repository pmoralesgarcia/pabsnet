Description: The code switching and different languages in the movie, Call Me By Your Name
---
I've seen the movie, *Call Me By Your Name* featuring Arnie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet a few times since it came out. Not only is it a queer film which I love but a film that includes multilingual characters.  What I melt inside of happiness when multiple languages are spoken in a movie. We hear English, Italian and French. One minute you hear French, then the same character will switch to English or Italian often times in the same scene. I find this very beautiful as someone who can speak multiple romantic languages. The code switching in my opinion is pretty good. Not to brag but it helps to know a few romantic languages to understand the others. I speak English, Spanish and French, fluently. I can for the most part understand Italian since there is so much cross over and there is so much cultural cross-context that I understand. I honestly turn off the subtitles when I watch this movie and others because I don't feel the need to see the translation. The movie is a lot more meaningful to me because I can understand the subtleties of the languages and how people express themselves in such languages. 


Movies and TV shows that can switch between languages are so cool!
