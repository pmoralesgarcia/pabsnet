It’s been a few days since I moved to San Francisco. I’ve been starting to get things organized but it almost seems there is no end. I enjoy taking breaks and leaving the apartment. Going on walks around the neighborhood is fun but I always go on an adventure. I’m getting my steps on and I have fun! I also get a snack or coffee while on an adventure. The sidewalk and my legs are possibly the limit.

Eventually, I found myself near Powell Station to take a break. As I was leaning against a wall, I asked myself, “What should I do to feel that I live here?” and “What is cheap but fulfilling?”

Hmm….

It came to me! I yelled out loud “I know! I’ll get a library card today!” Mind you, I’m at a busy location in the city. I think I started a bit of people waiting for the street car. There could be worse things to be yelling for in a city. Wouldn’t you get excited if you wanted to get a library card? Going to the library is exciting! I’m excited to go visit one of the oldest public institutions offered to the public! If I know anything about libraries in big cities, their main branch must be beautiful. Onward to the [San Francisco Public Library](https://sfpl.org/)!

Man! When I walked into the SF Library, it was pretty cool! It’s pretty modern! There is lots of elbow room to roam around!

As I’m walking towards the library, I fill out the [online application](https://sflib1.sfpl.org/selfreg) to start the process and get the confirmation number that I was provided.


Then when I got to the desk, I was asked for this confirmation number, identification, and some proof of where I lived such as a utility bill or lease agreement. The process was super easy. The people working at the library were very friendly.

Here is the library card design that I chose. It was either between the SF Giants or the drawing a second grader. Obviously, I went with the drawing because I don’t care about baseball. The drawing is pretty cool! Better than I could ever do.

After getting my library card, I explored the various floors throughout the library. This place is massive! Various items caught my eye. They let you borrow vinyls! Who does that!? I’m over the moon!

I didn’t know that the San Francisco Public Library is a Government Information Center (GIC). It’s very accessible to get documents from various levels of government.

> The Government Information Center (GIC) provides free access to United States, California, San Francisco, and Bay Area regional agency government documents, and to materials on public policy, political science, public administration, and the law.

I’ll have to spend more time exploring the library system and its website to see how I can maximize the resources available to me. I want to support the library more. This is a lesson to utilize public libraries and other public resources available to constituents.

Getting my library card was an easy experience. Everyone should be able to use the library. I'm excited to be spending a lot of time here! The important thing about the library is you don't have to buy anything to work on things or read a book. 

I got to check a book out!
