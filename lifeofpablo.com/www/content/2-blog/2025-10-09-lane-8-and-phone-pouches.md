We take our phones everywhere with us and I mean everywhere! What are the odds you're reading this on your morning communte or in the kitchen catching up on your RSS feed? Heck without our phones, the phrase, √èf you didn't take a photo, did it even happen?" Our lives for some reason must be captured every waking moment. It doesn't always have to be! 

Let's back track to last Friday. I'm dog sitting for some friends and it's a Friday night. I've been looking forward to going to a show with my good friend after a few days of sitting. I attended the [Lane 8](https://lane8music.com/) Concert! It's been years since I've seen him in concert. I got all dressed in my show attire. Nothing fancy. Just a T-Shirt and shorts and my shiny teeth and me! I got dinner with my friend beforehand. All the pre-show activities. 


We got in line for the show. It's the usual routine, "GET YOUR IDS OUT!" or "Have your tickets ready at the door." Hence, our tickets our on our phones. Once they scanned our tickets, the staff handed me a pouch. I was a little confused and I was like, "Oh?!" Then, I shrugged and place my phone in the pouch. The pouch can't be opened at the show. In order to open it, it has to be opened with a magnet similar to the security tags you find at the clothing store. It's been a while since I've experienced this. I was all for it. 


Don't get me wrong, I think we are all wired to have unconditional access to our phones and having a barrier that prevents us can put people on edge. Once your phone is in the pouch after a few minutes, the urge to use it and to simply pull it out of your pocket for no reason of pulling out your phone also goes away. The pouch is grippy enough it's not falling out of your pocket. I know there's psychology behind this.  

I really appreciated having my phone in a pouch. It brings me joy I can be in the moment. I think in our day in age, we lack that ability unless we're put in a situation like this. I really appreciate Lane 8 have his ticket goers not use their phone. You get more value out of the ticket you paid for.
