Description: We made an igloo!
---
"Yesterday was quite the cold adventure! It involved snow but I mean A LOT of it! I love winter. Having snow days in colllege is the best thing that could happen to sleep-deprived students. I managed to get some extra shut eye. Seriously though, these snowdays make me feel like a little kid again. You do not know the excitement when I found out UNK canceled clasess to have not one but two snowdays in a row? Man I LOVE COLLEGE! Its music to my ears.

Instead of being a lazy bum and staying in bed all day, I decided to spend my day outside in the good ol' Nebraska cold winter. My friends and I spend the day outside in the beautiful Nebraska weather, winter. The goal for the day was to make an igloo. We started right after lunch. My best friend, <a href=""http://instagram.com/officialsamharp"" target=""_blank"">Sammy</a> and I spent the day carving out a snow pile to make an igloo. Of course we could not go without throwing the occasional snowball at each other and others that walked by! We bad! ?We used our inner architecture and construction skills as well as our inner child to good use to make the perfect one! It was fun to work on it together!

Here is the end result with me in it.

Question of the day!??
