When the word *gardening* comes to mind, many think of maintaining a small plot of land. I envision, peppers, tomatoes, peaches, or simply a flower garden. This is exactly what I see in my parent's garden back in Nebraska. A garden can mean so many things due to culture, relationships, activism, hobbies, etc.

A garden I think of often is the country side in Oaxaca. I've gone hiking here for many years since I was a kid. Exploring here gives me a sense of reconnecting with my roots. It let's me explore with no limit to what I can find or experience. It helps me be in the moment. This garden to me is infinite.

It's a beautiful place to walk through when everything is green or dry. I really admire the beauty of it. There are so many native plants surrounding me. I see the cactus, the native grasses, the carrizo (giant reed) and any plant offspring that falls on the ground. 

There are so many fields of crops as well. Nature and agriculture co-existing. It's weird how well they blend in with each other.

My favorite time to enjoy the garden is sun down. All the colors are breath taking to watch and see how day becomes night. There are fun activities you can do at night time during a hike such as picking azucenas (lilies).

This is the land my ancestors lived on. I've lived on this land as well. I must continue to visit and reconnect with the people before me. 

Nature is so beautiful. We must protect it at all costs.

## Picking Azucenas (Lilies)
Picking azucenas is a common summer activity in Oaxaca where you walk in the country side during sundown. The azucenas will bloom at night instead of closing like many flowers do. The goal is to go around and pick as many azucenas and make it a goal to pick more than your family or friends. It's a good bonding event with people and it's a good bonding activity with nature.

Here is a picture of me showing off my picked azucenas.
