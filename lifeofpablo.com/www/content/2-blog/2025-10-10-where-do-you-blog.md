Currently, I'm writing this blog post on a [BART](https://bart.gov) train heading back to San Francisco. I haven't been writing as much lately and Ive been wanting to spend my time better on my commutes. Looking at my phone so much makes me feel like a zombie at times. I defintely need more self-reflection where I tap in my own thoughts instead of being on auto-pilot.  This got me thinking about the question, "Where do people write their blog posts?" 


This coming week I challenge myself to write a blog post at the park? I want to write more for the remainder of the year. 


Where do you write your blog posts? Where do you consider the most awesome place you've written a post?
