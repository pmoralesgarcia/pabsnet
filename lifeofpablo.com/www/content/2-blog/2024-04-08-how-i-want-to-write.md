This blog post is my participation to [Homebrew Website Club - Writing Edition](https://events.indieweb.org/2024/04/bonus-online-homebrew-website-club-writing-edition-GfCS201HYMFe) hosted by [Sara JakÅ¡a](https://sarajaksa.eu/). Thank you so much for hosting! You should read Sara's blog!

I'm writing this post on topic mentioned on the event description. 

> Any topic connected to writing can be covered here. Some of the possible topics include the process of writing, the joys of writing, the frustration some could have, how to improve it, what to write about or people can just showcase what they have written (or see it written on the web) and why they like it. You can also bring your own questions about writing that we can discuss or even trouble shoot. Or you can just listen to other people's ideas. All ways of participating are alright.

## The joys of writing.
Writing helps soothe
## My (sometimes) chaotic process

Since I started to write again, my writing has improved significantly. I've been more expressive as I share with the reader. My writing journey is only just starting. I've broken a few barriers with myself. I still feel that I need to break another layer of myself. Often, I find myself holding back. What am I holding back? Honestly, I over think things too much and that is frustrating. That leads to me sitting on a post for a few days before I touch it again. That if I am determined to finish it, even if it takes me a while look at it. Here is the typical stage of what my writing process goes. 

1. write a few words
2. Delete
3. Overthink
4. scream
5. walk away
6. try again, 
7. repeat
8. eventually finish the post.

I will admit my writing process is a bit chaotic. Not all of my writing is like this, Only a few posts. This is only one part of my writing process.
