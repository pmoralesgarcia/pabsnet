Tonight, will be my last full day in Oaxaca. I will return to the United States tomorrow. So many emotions are running through my head. I am sad that I have to return to my life back home. I enjoyed so many great moments with people by rekindling old relationships. I became a version of myself I usually don't see often in the States. I learned so many lessons I took at heart. 

I <i class="fa-solid fa-heart red"></i> you Oaxaca,

Pablo
