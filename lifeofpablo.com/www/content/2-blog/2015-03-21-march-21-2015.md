Description: Just my thoughts on this day
---
â€¯Well didn't wake up til 9:45a. Got ready for work. What a drag. I wonder why I have this job? Got some breakfast before work Yum!! ==redacted== My day went from annoyed to misery. It was stressful, no one showed up for work so I was trying to do everything myself as so was my employees. I am thankful for them. This job stresses me out a lot. I just have a way of coping with this negative energy. It is probably not good for me to have all this building on inside me. Everything was a mess. Why me? I left at 8p. Got all loaded up. Went home. ==redacted==
