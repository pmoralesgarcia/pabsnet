What a year 2023 has been! I've learned so much about myself and hit so many milestones. This will be my first year in review I ever post. I've written brief year in reviews on paper in the past. My year in review for 2023.

### I started a Company
* I filed and started my own company called, Pabs Tech, LLC. This has been something that had in the back of my mind for a long time. I only did very tiny projects with my company. 
* I'd like to have more projects where I can help others suceed in there projects.

### Helping Friends
* I started to help my friends build a small game.
* Help friends with their projects.

### Blogging
100 Blog posts! This blog post is number 100 for 2023. This is the most I've written on a personal site. I'm really proud of myself. This year I got back into blogging. I am so happy I did. I wrote a blog post on [why I blog](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/why-i-blog).

### The IndieWeb
I joined the IndieWeb this year! I've meet some amazing people who have motivated me in so many ways. I find them inspiring. This is a great communithy to join. I only wish I would have done it sooner. 

* I got to meet up with an IndieWeb community member while I was visiting Los Angeles. 
* I've attended almost every Homebrew Website Club (remote) since March. 
* I started building an IndieAuth extension for Datenstrom Yellow

### Podcast
* Started a podcast on my website called [Pablo's Thought Podcast](https://lifeofpablo.com/podcast/) on things that I want to share.

### Photography
I really explored photography and videography. I made some major leaps and bounds in both analog and digital photography. My camera visited new cities.

* I posted a [Photography Year in Review](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/my-photography-year-in-review-2023) of my favorite shots.

### Outdoors
* I've gone on 10 hikes this year! Darn it! I live in California and I should make more use of the natural facilities.

### Traveling Around
I did some traveling this year. I've been telling myself that I need to travel more of the United States this year even if I have visited these places before.  I went to new places in California and went to places in California I've been to in the past. I even went to the same place on the East Coast Again. 

* I visited two Buzzfeed Offices in Los Angeles and New York City.
* I attended NYC Climate Week for the first time
* I visited wine country for the first ime

Cities:

* San Francisco
* Los Angeles
* Mexico City
* Napa Valley (Wine Country)
* New York
* Oaxaca, Mexico
* San Luis Reservoir, California 



### Things I have learned in 2023
* I'm learned to start loving myself. I started going to therapy. I'm starting to unravel and start understanding why I've seen myself in such a negative light.
* It's okay to make mistakes. Learning from them is key to improve.
* Feel less guilty in enjoying time for myself. 
* Being active consistently is key. It helps me stay motivated knowing I don't always have to go hard. Consistency is key.

## What about 2024 ?

I have a lot planned for 2024. I will continue to travel with friends but also go places on my own. I will need to go on more [artist dates](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/reply-to-tracy-durnell-artist-dates). 

* I'm planning to host an IndieWebCamp in Sacramento.
* I'd like to run a marathon.
* I'd like to learn how to dance.

Here's to a great 2024!
