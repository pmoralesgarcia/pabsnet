It's been two years since I left Nebraska. Nebraska was the state that saw me grow up. My new home is now living in California. 

I've made new friends.

I'm more comfortable with myself as a person.
For the longest time, I was never comfortable with who I was. I lost direction.

find the person I've always wanted to become. For many years, I lost control of who I was. All that ambition, all those goals were pushed back. Truly, I want to learn how I can become more expressive with myself. I want to reconnect with myself. Blogging is only one piece of putting me back together.

I've grown as a person.

I've grown my career.

I joined new groups.

I advocate more for rights.

What it's like leaving Nebraska.

Why I feel ashamed of Nebraska even thought it's home.

Happy I traveled out.
