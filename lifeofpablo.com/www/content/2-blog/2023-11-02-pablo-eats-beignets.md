<div markdown="1" class="roboto f3 lh-copy center measure">What you're watching is an unedited video of me eating beignets at a Farmer's Market next to a mall in Los Angeles. I was carrying my camera in different parts of Los Angeles. I handed my friend the camera before we even know we were going to eat beignets. I told him to go crazy. He came up with the idea of recording me eating beignets and to share my thoughts. I think it's kind of funny. It reminds me of the early days of YouTube and watching it on 360p quality. For the young kids out there, high definition was not common for video streaming like it is today! 

The camera in use was [Canon DM-GL2](https://youtu.be/KycQ2i0lt90) which recorded on mini-dv tapes. I felt like I was going back in time.

I am learning to be more comfortable with myself and not worry as much on what people think about me. I'm letting myself be a bit more comfortable with myself. Not being comfortable with myself has hurt me so much in my past. So now is the time for me to shine. 

Please enjoy this video. I hope it brightens your day with a good laugh!
