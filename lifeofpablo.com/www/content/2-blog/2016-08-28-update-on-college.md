"Junior year of college is the turning point of most people's education. It is the time where the most people are deep into their major. You know, the point where it seems too late to turn back. This is not the case for me.

I've changed my major various times to in the last two years. It has not been the easiest process. In most cases it revolved around me jumping back and forth between different areas of science or healthcare related fields to humanities. Not deciding what I wanted in my life has had an effect on my greatly. Many friends know to what extent this led too. Thinking back on this tossing and turning made me realize how I truly did not have a passion for the sciences. You know what it really showed me? I am a person who is very stubborn. I was in denial. Deep down inside, there was no want for me to continue in the sciences. My mindset was not open to explore other options. I felt like a failure if I did not become something in the sciences or be something in healthcare. Avoiding disappointment and failure had become the way my life driving towards.

There comes a time where you have to wake up and come to reality that you really do not have interest in what you are shooting for after attempting various attempts. I should have followed my heart from the very beginning. My advice to you,
<blockquote>""Do not let anyone tell you what you should study. Only y0u know what you want in life.""</blockquote>
I did that mistake and did not follow my dreams right away. It took a lot of courage for me to stand up to myself. It is sort of shocking, huh? The mind is is your worst enemy. I am glad that I did what I did.

Now I am following my passion. A passion that I have always known to have since the first time I took this class in high school. There is this a major sense of relief. I announce that I will fully commit to become a teacher and strive for what I feel that I will do best
