With all the injustices happening right now to my people, I've been researching civil rights cases and the progress that has been made. It's time to make more progress to protect our civil rights. 

**[A Latinx Resource Guide: Civil Rights Cases and Events in the United States](https://guides.loc.gov/latinx-civil-rights/introduction)** - Library of Congress

> This research guide from the Hispanic Reading Room at the Library of Congress focuses on 20th and 21st century court cases, legislation, and events that had important impacts on civil rights in Chicana/o/x, Hispanic, Latina/o/x, Mexican-American, and Puerto Rican communities the United States. Each page provides an overview and timeline of a civil rights topic and some breadth of research material for further study at the Library of Congress or your local library. The facts presented draw from Library of Congress materials and external sources listed.
> 
> The first of its kind, this comprehensive online compendium of Civil Rights resources includes references to search and seizure, legal representation, self-incrimination, immigration, medical care, and equal access to educational resources. The Hispanic Reading Room will link this guide to webinar and podcast content in which scholars and community members help contextualize these court cases, legislation, and events. Since civil rights events are ongoing in Latinx communities, these references aim to connect the past with the present.
