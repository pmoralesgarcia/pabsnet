I don't remember the last time I spent time with myself. Moving to San Francisco, starting a new job, and getting settled busy has been an understatement. It's just been go, go, go! 

I finally got a mattress to sleep on. I was sleeping on a yoga mat that was quite comfy when you added some thick blankets. It was time to start sleeping on a mattress. The bed frame is coming soon. Oh wait, I also need a couch! Baby steps! Oh gosh, I need lots of things. I need to get rid of stuff. 

Focus!!


Today, I hopped on the bus to Golden Gate Park. The urge to leave my neighborhood for the day has been on my mind for a while.  When I got off the bus, right off the bat I started riding my board. I haven't been on a board in a long time so subtle movements had me on edge. I became more comfortable with it. The breeze hit my face so nicely. I felt like heaven.

People were having picnics, riding their bikes, playing games, and simply just hanging out.  This made me extremely happy. 

After a while, I took a break and found a quiet area to journal. It's been a while since I've done this. Writing down my thoughts on paper brought me at ease with the anxiousness I felt when I left my apartment. Writing it down sucked it out of me. 

I forgot that Golden Gate Park is next to Ocean Beach. So I figured I might as well ride my board to the beach! I love the beach! I zipped through the park to get there and man did it not disappoint. 

I enjoyed having time for myself. I don't regret it today. Today was an artist date.

The day concluded with me hanging out at Noisebridge.
