Description: Just my thoughts on this day
---
I am finally back from my trip that I planned out with my friends. Where did I go? Good Question! I went to Seattle and Vancouver, BC to check out a new part of the world. Relatively close I should say. Checking out those places has been real fun! This vacation was well needed! Work was starting to get to me! I did not know how much longer I was going to take it.  

 I always tend to pack the day before my trip instead of planning ahead. I need to work on that. So I packed enough clothes, at least I thought I did. Then went to bed kind of late. I woke up at six in the morning to make it out the door by 7am. What is sleep these days.
