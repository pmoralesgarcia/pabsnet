So last week was the end of my speech class. The first few days sucked because I had surgery on my nose. Everything went well. That's a different story thought :)

This was the first time I ever bought a college book. That sad part was that we barely used it in the three weeks of the speech class. What a waste of money! Anyhow, it was a fun class but weird at the same time. Weird reasosn to be undisclosed.... I got to be around people I knew. This gave me reassurance, well whatever I got out of it. I hated doing speeches. I'm actually okay at them but give me <strong>panic attacks</strong> (often you can't tell.) In order to survive one had to

The class got more comfortable as time went on. Taking this speech class has taught me a lot about myself.  I found some weaknesses that I have improved on.

<ul>
    <li>Being more confident</li>
    <li>More ability to speak to large audience.</li>
    <li>Less worrying of what others things</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

Tip of the day. Take a college speech class in the summer. Not only is it shorter but also you have less people to present towards than a whole lecture hall full of students during the school year. It is less stressful.
