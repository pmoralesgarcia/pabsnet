I think about you often. I want you here, but you're there. When I do see you, I have the best of times. Every time my phone buzzes and it's you, you brighten my day. You bring me happiness, pleasure, and enlightenment. I forget my problems when I'm with you. 

I think of your beautiful blue eyes. Your eyes entrench me. I get lost in the pool of blue. I love it when your eyes smile. You shine. Everything around you illuminates. I'm left in awe.

You're still figuring yourself out. You're on a journey. I don't want to impede your journey path. I must let go of you. I must let go of your hand. My journey must continue.

I'm crying as I write this. I'm crying because I want the best for you. I wish you happiness. I wish you all the best. I will miss you. I hope you find that perfect person. I hope to find that perfect person. You're that perfect person, but we can't be together.

There's a 
&nbsp;&nbsp;stream 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes. 


I must continue my journey. I deserve what's best for me. I don't know where this road will take me. I don't know which road to take. I want to take the happy one, but which one is that one? The road signs are missing. No matter the road, it will be bumpy at times. Turning back isn't an option.

This isn't closing the book on us, you'll still be there. I'm off to the next chapter in our story.
