Today is the 6th of May, and I turn 29 years old! Woo hoo! I've lived on this earth for 29 years. Time flies and I honestly didn't think I would have made it this far but here I am! That being said, I have officially entered my last year of my 20s. It’s a tad bitter sweet. but the positive overtakes the negative by a long shot. I reflect the growth I’ve had when I entered my 20s.

28 was a fun year of adventures and of learning. It was very fulfilling. I'm smiling as I think of the things I did this year. I would say 28 was a level up in all aspects. I felt more accomplished and I had an increased sense of self-direction.

* Traveled with friends
* Took myself on Artist Dates
* Helped develop a game with Friends
* Getting Google Certified in a few areas
* Voted in my first California Primary
* Sang in a few choir concerts

29 will be a great transition year into the next decade of my life. I’m still discovering who I am as an individual. I now know more about myself than ever. I feel a bit wiser. This has been a year of a lot of reflection. 

There is so much to learn about this world and where I stand in it. I continue to learn from people around me and the things unknown to me. What does it mean to be a Mexican-American at 29 years of age?

A lot will happen this year. Many events this year will have an effect on me directly and indirectly. I am excited and terrified for what's to come. I will keep my head up and fight for the greater good. I've learned not to be anxious of things I can't control yet because they haven't happened yet. Being more in the present is key to the well being of myself.

I've made many mistakes in years past. that I don't want to replicate. There are things I am not proud of but I've come to terms of not living in the past. I don't allow myself to beat myself up as hard as I used to. There's no need spend energy on things that don't matter anymore. 


Just learning to love myself this past year and I am continuing to work on myself. I'm in a better place now than when I had just turned 28. My mental health, my physical health, and emotional wellness are more in tune. Now that I've set the path, it's only up for these. I'm more balanced now. 

On a positive note, I'm really excited to start school again. I really value learning and I have a desire to have a master's degree. Later this summer I'm also getting a promotion at work. 



### Some items I wish to accomplish (no particular order) at 29
Learn Chinese

I WILL join cross fit or attend exercise classes.

I would like to learn to dance.

Get the startup I'm working on off the ground. 

Work on personal and work projects that have been on the back burner. I hope to reach these goals.

Join a LGBT sports league.

Get my financials in order. I should set up a will.

Go on a solo adventure far away from home. 

Go on more hikes!


### Looking Forward
There are so many positive things happening in my life. It's only up from here! I'm proud of who I'm becoming Here's to my 29th birthday and what's to come in the next 365 days around the sun!
