Today is March 5th, 2024. I voted in the California Primary for the first time since moving here. I guess I do officially live here.   I love how easy it is to vote in person here in Sacramento. The original plan was to submit my mail-in-ballot but I accidentally got my primary ballot soaked when I was carrying my water bottle. Of course, I forgot to request a new one and days went on without thinking about it. Then it dawned on me that today was voting day. I had in my navigation to a specific voting location and on the way there, I saw another polling location. I canceled the navigation and pulled into the polling places I had just driven by. I was so excited because, why go out of my way when I can do it right then and there!

Checking in was easy. I gave my basic information for them to print off the ballot. There was an option to do it electronically but I chose paper instead. I was briefed on where the ballot drop-box was located to place the  ballot after I have completed filling it out. My ballot was placed in a secrecy vanilla folder to provide discretion in carrying it between the voting official station and the voting cubicle. After receiving the ballot, I went to a voting station cubicle and filled in my ballot. I voted for those I felt would do good in their current or future positions. I had done some research on the candidates. If you don't, you really should see what each candidate stands for and look at the finer details. Then, once I was satisfied with myself filling in all the ovals, I placed the ballot in the secrecy vanilla folder to prepare to turn it in. I walked across the room to place the ballot in the ballot drop-box.

Finally, I got a sticker to show off that I voted. This time I chose a sticker that says, "Yo Vot√©" which is Spanish for, "I Voted".

It was that easy! It seemed very seamless. This really motivates me to pay attention in local elections that help shape the future of the city I am living in. Voting is important and a fundamental right which I am happy to exercise. I'm happy I participated in doing my civic duty to vote. We all have a voice. We are the voice for those who can't.
