I'm excited for this weekend. I'm catching up with some friends and simply hanging out. I'm really excited for Saturday. I'm singing with the Sacramento Pop Choir along with fellow students of mine at the Sacramento Pop Choir. I'll sing along with other baritones/tenors to the song, [*Lights*](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=lights+ellie+goulding&ia=web) by Ellie Goulding. I forgot how much I enjoy this song. It's been a while since I've formally studied music. The music teacher at school got me going again! Kudos to her! 

Singing makes me happy. I am not that good but I can sight read and understand how sheet music works. I have done for many years.  Over the last few months, I've started to practice music formally again. There is something so magical about reading music and interpreting it. I'm also supporting my students who want to learn more. They are so talented. Wish me luck or I'll say to myself, "Break a leg!"

 [Verse 1]
> I had a way then  
> Losing it all on my own  
> I had a heart then  
> But the queen has been overthrown  
> And I'm not sleeping now  
> The dark is too hard to beat  
> And I'm not keeping now  
> The strength I need to push me
