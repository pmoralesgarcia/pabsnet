Hooray!! I joined the IndieWeb a year ago! I'm really excited and happy that I joined this community. By joining the IndieWeb, I've increased my presence on the internet and have slowly been retreating from using centralized media. It's just a good time. I'll keep my excitement short!

Things I've done or participated:

* Met so many amazing people
* Hosted an IndieWeb Carnival
* Attend Homebrew Website Club
* Started Blogging again.
* Started more development

### What is the IndieWeb?

The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the “corporate web”.

> It is a community of independent and personal websites connected by open standards and based on the principles of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning your content.
