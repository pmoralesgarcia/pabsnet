Yesterday was a bitter sweet day for me. This has been a day that has been coming. It doesn't really hit you until all their things are packed up ready to be loaded in the moving truck. I look around at my friends almost empty apartment with nothing on empty walls. The sad feeling the emotions take place. Maybe, it's the allergies. These friends are very special to me as they are one of the first friends I made in California. These friends made me feel right at home as I moved a place unfamiliar to me. It all started just by saying "hello!" as I was moving into the unit I was moving into. We hit it off right off the bat. We would go cruising on our boards. We did disc golfing (which I'm not good at). Go on adventures throughout California. We would go over to each other's place. They threw a welcome back party after returning from South Korea after being gone for a month. They help me experience new things that definitely got me out of my comfort zone. My friends helped me grow as a person. Most importantly, they taught me how to be more fun. 

I'm happy they are off to a new adventure. I want them to be happy and do what is best for them. I am grateful to have made friends with them. I know that this is goodbye for now. We'll be in touch. I'll send post cards. We'll see each other along the way. I wish you all the best. See you all soon.  

Thank you for all the memories,  
Pablo
