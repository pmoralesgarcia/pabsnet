>My favorite part of Apple Music’s “Spotify Wrapped” clone is seeing what album broke the app and logged 100 plays. Last year was a Charlie Brown Christmas with an honorable mention of The Prince of Egypt. This year was Pixar’s Brave score.

> I’m guessing it’s a bug in their Chromecast integration or possibly albums with various artists. I think the most plays of a song from those albums was 15. And to think this company brought us the iPod. How the mighty have fallen.
