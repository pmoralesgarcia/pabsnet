Its  been an interesting start to the new year.

This week I am on a trip to Denver with my three best friends Sammy and Sam. These are some of the coolest dudes you guys will ever meet. It has been an interesting trip so far.

We left Nebraska on in the morning on Tuesday. When we got there we got some grub at a great place. Then we hit up downtown.  We did a bit of shopping and just walked around. It was fun just being in that urban enviorment. All the buildings are beautiful. Downtown Denver has really cleaned up their act. I like seeing the street performers (the few in the winter).

Then we hit up Redrocks Amphitheater and Park where we did some climbing up  the stairs and enjoyed the beautiful sights and sceneries of the area.  It was so relaxing. Any part of outside Denver is nice! I like nature. Twas fun. I do not think that I could live in the city

We had dinner at <em>Five Guys</em>, the burgers were so delicious. Where has it been my whole life. There were many places where we hit up for yummy food!

The nightlife in Denver is pretty swell!! The city surprises me so much!!!

Found some good books at the Thrift Shop!! Who knew thrifts shops were so badass.

We went everywhere in Denver. The malls here are amazing and huge.  So many sights we wanted to see but time was the enemy. The next trip will be even better.

Time to hit the road! This was a trip that I really enjoyed especially with your buddies. Now it is time to go home and get back to reality. School starts soon and I got to get back to the whole routine. See you soon Nebraska!!
