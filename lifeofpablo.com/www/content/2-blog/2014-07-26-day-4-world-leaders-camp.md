"I forgot to write for yesterday. Might as well write for today also!

We started our day with origami. It was a fun activity (if you can get past step 1.) I've done some origami over the years. It was a struggle a bit trying to build something. Not to bad after you get the hang of it.

Then We had a leadership activity with Dr. Machida. It was really fun getting to know about Japan and Dr. Machida's experiences abroad at a young age. It really motivates me to study abroad!! :)

I also learned how to use chopsticks. Who knew that it could be fun? It was a challenge none less.... Now I want to use them at any Chinese place.

After Lunch We got to meet some of the students that have been on a study abroad program. Some went to the Czech Republic or Netherlands. They told us their crazy adventures. They also explained some struggles and surprises they experience. I felt like I related to them since I have also gone out of the country plenty of times. They really assured us that it is totally worth it.

We had some of the international students help us with calligraphy. They helped us all write our names in Japanese. This but also words that had a meaning to our own. I picked 'potential' and 'perseverance.' I say they did a great job . Props to you guys.



The chopsticks lesson came to great use!! We went to a Chinese restaurant. I ordered spicy chicken. Used my chopsticks to eat my entree. I felt like I succeeded at a life.

Later everyone decided to take naps after a very busy day. I passed out on my bed, Â so did my roommate on his.

I stayed up later to watch some funny movies... it was totally worth it :) :)"
