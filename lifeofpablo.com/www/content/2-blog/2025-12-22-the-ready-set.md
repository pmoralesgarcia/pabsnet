I forgot how much I enjoyed the song, *Love Like Woe* by The Ready Set. I'm pretty sure I was a teenager when this song came out! It's still a bop. It's one of those feel-good songs while you think of your crush. I've always wanted to see them live in concert! They were touring in Los Angeles last year but didn't realize it! Hopefully, they come around near San Francisco or Sacramento!

What song made you dream of your crush?
