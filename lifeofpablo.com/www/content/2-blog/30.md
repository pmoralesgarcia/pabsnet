Today, I turn 30 years old. Woohoo! I guess I’m no longer a 20-something-year-old. These last 10 years have flown by quickly but man, have they been memorable. It’s a tad bitter sweet. The positive overtakes the negative by a long shot. I can’t stop the aging process. If only it were that easy!


Honestly, at this very moment, I don’t feel any different. I still feel energetic and craving adventure. I think these song lyrics from T-Swizzle describe how I feel.

> (Hey!) I don't know about you
>
> But I'm feeling twenty-two


In hindsight, looking at myself in the mirror more recently, I notice my facial hair is starting to turn white. Nothing like a fresh shave that still makes me look young and boyish. I must being doing something right with my skin routine (and maybe good genes from my parents)!

## Reflections
I reflect on the growth I’ve had since I entered my 20s. My 20s were about

*  Learning
* Falling and rising
* Going on adventures.
* Loved ones

I learned some great lessons along the way. Some lessons were not so easy to swallow. Man, did I learn. There are so many things I know now that I wish a 20-year-old me knew. One of the things I wish he knew was, “Love yourself more!” I do love myself more than ever. I’m happier with who I’ve become. I’m not done learning who I become. I don’t think that ever stops. There were many moments in life when I hit my absolute lowest. Those are moments I’m not proud of. While I did manage to get myself out of them, I did come back stronger. Another lesson here -  ask for help and use the resources available to you. You’re not alone, I promise.

Take risks! Take more! I'm thrilled to have moved to California. I still can’t believe that this guy from Nebraska moved to San Francisco. I was grateful to have gone on so many adventures. I learned so much about myself getting away. Some of my best learning moments have been from strangers and experiences with myself in another country. Who knew you could learn something so new about yourself at 3 am while eating a dõner kebab on the streets of Berlin?

When I was in my early 20s, I said something along the lines of,  “I get to be away from my parents! Freedom!” When I was in college, I didn’t want to come home as often, or if I went home to visit, I would not stay for too long. Now more than ever, I miss my parents. Now, I  live far away from them. I only get to have home-cooked meals a few times a year. It honestly makes me sad watching them get older. I still need my parents. I do my best to call every day. My relationship with them has been stronger than ever. I am thankful for all the things they’ve done for me and my siblings

Who’s cutting the internet onions on here?



### Travel
I’m very fortunate that I traveled a lot in my 20s. I want to thank my parents for taking us to Mexico as a young kid.

I’ve traveled to Canada, all over Europe, South Korea, Mexico, and various parts of the United States.

#### Travel Buddies
I got to travel with my favorite travel buddies, Sammy and Manny! We've have gone on some wild adventures. I’m very happy we stayed friends. Best travel buddies ever!

#### Best Birthday Ever! - Czech Republic
One of my favorite birthdays was when I was studying abroad in Europe. I visited my friends in the Czech Republic.

## Friends
I’ve made an amazing community of friends. People, I consider my family away from home. Learning from people whom I loved, making friends wherever I go! I’ve made so many friends.

## What goals do I have in my 30s?
There are a lot of things I want to accomplish during my 30s. I have a vision for the next few years! I’m hopeful I can find the right path to reach my goals

### Education
I truly value education. It got me where I am today! I was very fortunate to receive a great public school education. Others also need to have access to a great public school education. We must fight against the privatization of the education system. I want to continue to fight for public education. Public education provided me with so many opportunities.

I am currently doing my master’s degree at the University of Nebraska Kearney. My goal one day is to teach a class or two at the university level. It would be awesome to guide future teachers and help them be confident with technology use and go beyond 21st-century learning. I do miss being in the classroom.

I would like to receive a PhD.

I also want to improve my programming skills.

### Health
I’m working towards getting in better shape and thinking of long-term health. As I age, I know I won’t bounce back from injury as quickly. I know I must do everything in my power to take control of my health. Preventative measures are what will keep the hospital away.
Mental health is just as important.


### Adventures
I want to continue traveling. I want to visit more parts of the world. Ever since I last renewed my passport, the visa pages have been blank. The passport I had in my early twenties was pretty full. It’s so satisfying to look at the stamps and stickers on each page. I want to take my parents on a fun adventure as well

### Startup
I’ve been helping a friend with a startup and launching an idea that we have. I am hopeful this year will be great!

### Financial Independence
I want to make smarter choices with money. I’ve been reading up on financial literature to become better with money. Times are changing, and I must keep up with inflation, changing markets, AI, etc.

## Looking Forward

Overall, things are finally clicking. I’m excited for what’s to come and all the things to learn. I will reevaluate and reprioritize many things in life.

What have you learned in your 30s?

## How am I celebrating my birthday?

Luckily, I live in San Francisco, so there’s a lot to do! I will be celebrating the entire weekend with my friends in San Francisco! So stoked to watch Drag Disco with Trixie Mattel! Let’s put on some pink clothes and dance into my 30s!
