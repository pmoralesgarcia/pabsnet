I've had a presence since I was a young kid. I've been very fortunate to be around computers since i was three with these interactions been in school. 

Having access to computers was game changing for me and has helped me. I would say I signed up for MySpace when I was ten. I know I am such a rule breaker. When I discovered personal websites, my mind exploded . . . metaphorically.

## Curiosity didn't kill the cat

I remember when my parents upgraded from dial-up to DSL. I remember the lady at the phone company explaining all the details of the features included in our internet plan. Something that struck me was the FTP storage space. I thought, "Wait, I can create a my website and have it hosted for free?" This was in 2003 when I started my first personal website. I remember using basic HTML and clip art. I cringe just thinking about it. This was the stepping stone for me building and hosting websites. Using FTP was pretty advanced for an eight year old. I would stay up late just tinkering my site to make it perfect with poor HTML skills. It worked somehow?

## Expressing Myself 
I've always wanted to find ways to express myself. Since I was big into computers and tech, I figured I would use the website I built to share the things I enjoyed. I wanted to share who I was as a person. I had an idea who I was but I was still developing. 

## Inspired by others.
I would look at other people who would blog and that would make me super gitty. I remember stumbling upon [Matt Mullenweb](https://ma.tt) back in 2003 and being inspired by him. He and many others taught me a lot about blogging. Learning by (browsing the internet) doing. 

## Being Resourceful.
I would create new websites over the years. I couldn't afford to a pay for a website domain because I was eight years old and I wasn't going to ask my parents to spend money on something when I was more than grateful to have a computer and fast internet. I would use any free service I could until I could pay for it on my own. 

## Services I'd use
I would use a site in 2010 called Altervista where I officially used Wordpress for the first time. I made a big leap from HTML to the most popular CMS (of course I had no idea at the time). I decided this was the moment I would start expanding from a basic site to start blogging even if the posts had a few sentences. 
I used:

* Altervista
* DynDNS 
* Wordpress.com
* Freewebhosting

## Today 
Often, I really feel like that 8 year old who was discovering how to build things on the web.
