My friends and I started building a game using PICO-8 to build a game. One of my students was telling me about another project by Lexaloffle. It is called, [Picotron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php). I started messing with the preview version available on their site. It's been fun poking at it and seeing what it can do. I would say it's pretty neat and I've been having a blast. 

Picotron is a Fantasy Workstation for creating various things, not just games. On the surface reminds me of the [Mac OS 8.1 emulator](https://infinitemac.org/1998/Mac%20OS%208.1) or the [macintosh.js](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/macintosh.js) that runs as an electron app (javascript) on the surface. Picotron is web based compared to PICO-8 you have to install on your system. 

There is a plenty of [information provided](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php?page=faq) for picotron for anyone to learn more as well as a [roadmap](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php?page=roadmap) for the different features to be available over time. I'm really excited for certain features. 

It looks like it will cost $20 or so to have. 

Here are some of the demos on Picotron:
