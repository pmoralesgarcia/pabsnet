"Sleeping at the hotel in was one of the most comfortable places. Who knew old fashion was better? Breakfast wasn't what I was used to. It consisted of A slice of bread with cold cut (deli) meats. You cant forget a great cup of joe! What a simple breakfast? we made kolaches. Kolaches are a traditional food in the Czech Republic. They are formed like a cookie. We make a crater in the center to fill it with fillings. Fillings like apricot or cherry fillings. We also had cream cheese filling. Here is the result. <a href=""http://pabs.altervista.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tmp_23073-IMG_20140723_103515-737429513.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-260"" src=""http://pabs.altervista.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tmp_23073-IMG_20140723_103515-737429513-300x300.jpg"" alt=""tmp_23073-IMG_20140723_103515-737429513"" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></a>

Delicious right??

Then we went on a tour around Wilber. We learned the history and reasons people moved here. One was religious freedom. (Sound familiar?)



I got to play the bagpipes. It was odd but cool at the same time.

Then we learned how to dance polka and some waltz. It was fun. Now i can dance! (I was salsa dancing in Omaha yesterday.) Â  We had an amazing lunch that consisted of duck, dumplings, sourkrout, and a kolache for dessert. I tought it was best meal in a long time. Czech food is actually good and healthy. Richard I'm coming to the Czech Republic for more food. LOL :-P

To end the stay in wilber Nebraska the local children entertained us by showing us traditional dances in traditional outfits. I think it is cool that these children are continuing their traditions.

Now I'm back in the dorms. Going to go get ice cream or something. Then I'll go work out with my roommate and have some bro time.
