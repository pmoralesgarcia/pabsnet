📍: 

Last month I attended Meter's annual event called [*MeterUp*.](https://www.meter.com/meterup/bob-metcalfe) It was a very fun day listening to various talks. It was exciting listening to [Bob Metcalfe](https://www.meter.com/meterup/bob-metcalfe), who invented Ethernet.  There were plenty of other speakers who also had some great conversation points. 

Meter showcased their new line of products that are being released. It was visually appealing to see the new product line. I had the opportunity to touch and feel the inner workings of the product. It was so satisfying to feel the various parts!

I did some networking with others in the MSP space and learn what people use for their networking stacks for clients.
