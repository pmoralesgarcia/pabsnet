Today at the [Faight Collective](https://www.thefaight.com/) there was a poetry workshop tonight. The presenter talked about how he got into poetry. I wrote a poem (or something) while listening to Never Catch Me by Flying Lotus.

### Bananas


> Never Straight.
> 
> Pleasurable.
> 
> Bright. Immaculate.
> 
> A Model. Multipurpose. Versatile.
> 
> You bring me joy. And maybe health.
> 
> 
> You are important.
> 
> You age.
> 
> You were once golden.
> 
> No longer pleasurable.
> 
> Sags. Fragile. Disposable.
> 
> I should miss you.
> 
> 
> There are others. A new you.
