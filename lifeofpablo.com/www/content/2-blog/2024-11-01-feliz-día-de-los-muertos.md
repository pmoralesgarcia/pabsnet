Happy Day of the Dead! Feliz Día de Los Muertos 2024! 

This is an important holiday for me and my fellow Mexicans. This is a day (spills over into the weekend) we use to celebrate and reconnect with our loved ones. This is the time of year where we are closer to our loved ones. I think about my grandparents, my aunts and uncles, my cousins and, other loved ones. 

I hope to see you soon.
