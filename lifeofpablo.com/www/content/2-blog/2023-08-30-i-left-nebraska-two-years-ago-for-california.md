<h3 class="baskerville hot-pink underline">Some Back Story</h3>
Over the years, I reflected on how much I do love Nebraska and what it means to me. I moved away two years ago from my home state of Nebraska to the state of California. I believe it's safe to say that California is home. I've done a lot growing as a person. I am not the same person who was when I left Nebraska. I'm still growing.


<h3 class="baskerville hot-pink underline">Why Leave Nebraska?</h3>
Nebraska will forever be home. It was the place that saw me grow up. **I got a great public education.** It taught me how to say, "Ope!" and how to be a Midwestern Mexican Guy.

 It's been in my mind for a while to leave. That, "for a while" thought has been in my mind since I was a kid. At a young age I had all these dreams and ambitions to live in various places throughout the world. 

I was very fortune to have visited different places in high school and in university, I got to live in France through study abroad. These experiences solidified my need to venture off more throughout the United States. Traveling abroad since I was a young kid has helped me realize there are so many great things outside of Nebraska.  It's funny because I joke around how I've traveled more outside the country than in the country I reside in. I am very fortunate to have lived in Mexico for extended periods of time throughout my life. 

<h3 class="baskerville hot-pink underline">Preventing Resentment and Repeating the Mistakes of Others</h3>
I've always craved so much more than the simple life back home. I didn't want to feel trapped and become resentful for lack of trying to live in and experiencing new things in new places. I see many of the people who I grew up with and reflect on my own self. I didn't want that lifestyle. So many people who I had wished had left Nebraska for greener pastures didn't leave. I didn't want to be trapped.

<h3 class="baskerville hot-pink underline">Questioning the Environment</h3>
I've always questioned my environment. These are the questions:

* Why don't we have public transportation? 
* Why is it weird to walk on the sidewalk in such a walk-able town?
* Why are people of afraid of good change?
* Why don't we think of the needs of young people who will lead the future?


<h3 class="baskerville hot-pink underline">My Lifestyle</h3>

Being Nebraska wasn't fitting my lifestyle anymore. I had outgrown the town of 25,000 habitants. Growing up, I never really accepted myself as a person in various degrees. I tolerated myself at best. I was smiling without actually being happy. This fa√ßade of being known as, "the guy who always has a smile on his face," was getting old. It was draining me for years. I truly wasn't happy. No one would ever guess that. I lost myself as an individual and I also lost who I wanted to become as individual. Looking at myself in the mirror was not a true reflection of me. I just didn't feel like anything was truly going for me. There are so many things I wish I would have addressed sooner.

Leaving Nebraska was going to happen sooner than later.  I had a friend nudge me a few years back to finally do it. I am grateful he nudged me enough that I felt it in my ribs.

<h3 class="baskerville hot-pink underline">I'm Happier as a Person</h3>
I'm living in California now for two years now. Time flies! 

I'm a lot happier here. I'm my more genuine self. I'm still not where I want to be. This is something that I am working on. California is not a perfect place. 

I've made a lot more progress here. I'm slowly healing myself. This will take time.
