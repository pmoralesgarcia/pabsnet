   I would like to announce that I will be going to South Korea this summer! I will be traveling with other teachers from across the state.  It is through UNL and through Fulbright-Hays! We will be observing and learning about the Korean culture and their education systems. This will be a whole new adventure and can't wait to travel again and learn even more to become a better teacher down the road. I am in the process of learning my 4th language (Korean.)
