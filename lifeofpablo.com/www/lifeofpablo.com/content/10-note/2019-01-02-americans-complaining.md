I remember when I would be in Paris for a weekend and I would hear other Americans just complain that not everyone speaks English. Uncultured swines.

Just heard an American woman angrily tell an airport employee, “If you don’t speak English, then why are you working here?”

Ma’am… you’re in Shanghai, China.
