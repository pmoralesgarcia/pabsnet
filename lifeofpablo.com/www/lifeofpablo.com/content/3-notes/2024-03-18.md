Just testing Microsoft Copilot by using the band All Time Low as the topic of discussion. So, I asked it to provide the following:

It must provide me this list in markdown:

* Provide the name of the album
* Provide the record label
* Provide a description or background of the album

Not bad but still has a few issues.
