    <p class="e-content">Glad, I could help!! If you do decide to host your own music player, you should look into if any of them support S3 storage to reduce the traffic load on the server you are using depending on the amount of physical media or files stored on a drive. Backblaze is a good one. to look into. Adblockers have been a savior but now sites are getting too smart.</p>
