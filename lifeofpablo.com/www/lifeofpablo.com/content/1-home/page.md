I really thankful for my parents that they taught me the importance of growing up bilingual which led me to become a polygot. I was a teacher. I can say 'Go Green' in 4 languages. ðŸŒŽ I speak English, Spanish & French. I also know some Korean as I studied the language and I recently traveled there.  

Speaking of the Korean language, I was in Korea in summer 2022 [I documented my adventures](/korea)

I really like vinyls and film photography. There is something so fascinating about analog formats. The physical of it? 

Currently working on a few tech projects: ECO, AI/ML, Node, and rust

I like [DCD's Jackpot Juicer](lists/vinyls#22).

Living in CA, I have grown so much and made amazing friends
