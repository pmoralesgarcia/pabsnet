  <blockquote>
    <a class="p-item h-item" href="https://www.buenocafe.net/">Bueno Café</a> is a nice little neighborhood café . This cafe brings Latino flavors and traditions which are fond to me as someone who is Mexican/latino. It's hard to find places like this where I can talk to the barista in Spanish. It adds a pesonal touch.  It is nice to have a place to get your coffee essentials and pastries. It has a beautiful inside with a wall of famous artists and famous actors in latino culture. It's a very welcoming place.
