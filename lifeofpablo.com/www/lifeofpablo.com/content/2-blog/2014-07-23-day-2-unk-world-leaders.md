"Yesterday we spent the morning in an Spanish Culture activity. I learned a lot. Did you know Mexico is the largest speaking country?

We spent middle of the day out in Omaha. We went to a Hispanic Museum. It was interesting learning about Latin America. I was amazed by the fascinating artisan work. Anything from Â  then the group went to a Mexican Restaurant. I ordered the tamales and burrito. Nothing compares to homemade cooking.

The next destination was Wilber, NE otherwise famously known as ""Czech Nation."" The population has strong Czech roots that lead them to use the language all over the town.

We are staying here the night and leave in the afternoon. Got to see teens practice traditional polka dances. It was neat to see such tradition continue.

Later in the night we played many fun games to relax from the busy traveling. Too many laughs. ;-)
