Glad to be home. I had an appointment today at the eye doctor in Grand Island. had to get new contacts, go figure!! After that I went to the mall to shop for my sisters birthday. I found Lucas and his friends in sporting edge, we ended grabbing lunch  Mom tries to keep stuffing me with food. She gets mad because I do not eat as much as I used at  and thinks the worse of me. I did not work today. I did go around the park for a good run and kept my mind off things. It was glad to see people I havent seen in such a long time especially who graduated 4 years ago.
