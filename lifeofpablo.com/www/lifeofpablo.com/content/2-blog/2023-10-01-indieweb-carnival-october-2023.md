This month I am hosting this month's IndieWeb Carnvival on self-care and routine.

Learning self-care has been something I've been working on a lot this year. It has been something I neglected for many, many years. It has helped me be more aligned. 


## What is self-care ?

"a multidimensional, multifaceted process of purposeful engagement in strategies that promote healthy functioning and enhance well-being."

"Self-care means taking care of yourself so that you can be healthy, you can be well, you can do your job, you can help and care for others, and you can do all the things you need to and want to accomplish in a day." <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/self-care/" class="i"><sup>[2]</sup></a>


## Self-Care in the Digital Age

We live in age where we are always connected online. This also adds complexities balancing our lives. 



## Here are some prompts to help you get started or to build off of this post.

* What type of self-care routines do partake in?
* How do you incorporate self-care in difficult times?
* What has been your journey in reaching self-care and your routines.
