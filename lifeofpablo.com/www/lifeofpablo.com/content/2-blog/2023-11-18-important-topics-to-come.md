As I get comfortable with writing more, I'd like to write about some topics that are not so much in the public eye or ones that "We should really try to make it better." These are topics I've been very passionate about. 

These two topics are HIV and Public Transportation. I've been wanting to write more about these two for a long time.  

Many of us are aware of HIV and the epidemic during 1980s and 1990s. The topic of HIV can be sensitive topic for many for various reasons. HIV is still here with us. Science has found ways to curtail HIV infections and keep people alive but it's not elimated. I feel it's important to talk about still. 

Many of us didn't grow up with public transportion. The United States is a car centric country to get around from one place to another. The only way to suceed in United States is  to depend on having a car for opportunities. It shouldn't be that way.

For HIV I'd like to cover:

* AIDS Epidemic
* Resources for People with HIV
* How I got educated on HIV
* Volunteering/Helping those with HIV

For Public Transportation I'd like to cover:

* Access in Rural Areas
* Comparisons between the United States and the World
* How Disentregation and Destruction of Public Transporation isolated the United States
