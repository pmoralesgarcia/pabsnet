"Well I cant believe that summer is almost wrapping up. Some kids already started school while others are just dreading the thought of school being around the corner. Then there are us soon the be college freshman who are just worried for the absolute change that life is bring us.
Two weeks from now I am moving away to college. It is sad that many of us wont get to see the people that we have grown up with all of our lives. This is especially true in Small Town, Nebraska. People that we have got to the point where we just wanted them to disappear from our lives. Now it will hit us all that we will miss them. Some more than others. :( The thought just gives me the chills.

There are so many things I wanted to do this summer but I couldn't. Oh well I have more summers to come.

I have so much stuff to take to college. I have from the the bedding sheets to the flat screen television to carrying the school supplies.Â  Do I even have room to put it in my dorm? Will it even fit in my car?? Have I even started packing stuff up yet? Nah I'll just do that at last minute.

It is sad that I will be leaving the house that I have grown up in most of my life. I'll miss all the good cooking at home. Nothing fills up a dude more than a mother's cooking. Nothing compares anything else. Luckily I can drive back. It is only an hour away. So it is not a total loss.

I probably should start packing. I'll get to it eventually. I promise it wont be night before!!

I hope that I can say goodbye to everyone before I go off.
