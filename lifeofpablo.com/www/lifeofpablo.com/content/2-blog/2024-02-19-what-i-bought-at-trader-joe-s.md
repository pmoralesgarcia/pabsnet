I recently went to Trader Joe's on my day off today. I noticed prices over the last year have been going up everywhere and Trader Joe's is no exception. I've been working on only buying the things I only need or things to supplement the items I have at home. For example, I bought spinach dip to help me finish the chips I have at home and I bought baby carrots (Cut &amp; Peeled Carrots) to help finish the spinach dip. Inflation is coming on all of us hard. I almost gasped out loud in the store when I saw the price of a litter bottle of the [Extra Virgin Olive Oil](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/extra-virgin-olive-oil-liter-001465). I remember it being $8.99 now it's $10.99. It's just the little things that add up. I have to be extra mindful of the inventory of my kitchen and buy only the things I need and think of items that be versatile in use. 

One of my goals this year is to simply not be as wasteful. Adulting is a learning process.

Here is what I bought on this trip.
