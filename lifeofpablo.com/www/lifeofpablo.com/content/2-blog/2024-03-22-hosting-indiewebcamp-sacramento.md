Hello, I'm Pablo Morales from Sacramento, California and I participant in the IndieWeb. I am volunteering to host and organize the first [IndieWebCamp Sacramento](https://indieweb.org/Planning#Sacramento,_CA) (IWC).  is a great way to bring together your local IndieWeb community and to bring together people from the greater IndieWeb community. It is also quite challenging, requires co-organizers, and key details to succeed that are documented in this page.  

I'm looking for a co-host. A co-host would be someone who could help organize and assist in helping organize. It can be in person or remote as well. Having a co-host would help in making the event come to fruition and have the event be successful.


IWC Dates:  
The plan is to have it during a weekend.

* April 13-14
* April 20-21
* May 4-5, 2024
* June 1-2, 2024
* June 8-9
* Any other date recommendations?
