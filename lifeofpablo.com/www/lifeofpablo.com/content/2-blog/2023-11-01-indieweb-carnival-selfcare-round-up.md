October is a wrap! ðŸŽƒ I hosted October's [IndieWeb Carnival on self-care](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/indieweb-carnival-october-2023). Thank you to everyone who participated in this month's IndieWeb Carnival topic. I appreciate all the responses I recieved. I recieved so many perspectives on the topic. I chose this theme as this is something I am working on improving for myself.

## Responses
[Sara JakÅ¡a - Using 4 E of Cognition to Conceptualise Self-Care](https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/10/indieweb-carnival-october-2023-using-4-e-of-cognition-to-conceptualise-self-care/)

* I really enjoyed the way way you structured your reponse using the 4 E of cognition: embodied, embedded, extended, and enactivistic. I really appreciate the approaches using your educational background to explain. It has really helped me see things in a different perspective. I agree that self-care is "a process to adapt my life". One must adapt. You're right, I can't ignore self-care because whether or not I felt I was ignoring it. I was doing it whether I admit it or not. I now see it as having a low battery. It had some juice. I realize now I was also scared of myself, nervous of outcomes, and more. I realized many things. I ignored my ehealth. I really enjoy how you ended the response, "do the self-care for the reason of your better wellbeing." I am doing this for myself.Thank you for being so straight foward and not beating around the bush. 

[Grigor Malo - Should we care about self-care?](https://grgml.xyz/blog/indieweb-carnival-self-care/)

* I really enjoyed "[your] answer to the prompt" and the approach. I would agree with you some self-care/help guides do take the wrong approach. It often seems like how to appear to be fine on the outside but not actually on the inside. It's been hard in the pastto find self-care/help material related to my cultural background or for individuals who live in a multiculural life. There is no one size fits all. Hyper-individualism or individualism has been a conflicting thing for me. Why do we need to isolate ourself when things can also be experienced with other people as well. I also agree that action at the end of the day starts with the individual. "Caring about your self is a fundamentally selfish endeavour? Not really, or at least not if practiced properly." That is a beautifully written phrase. I share many of the same thoughts on wellness industry and the corporate wellness. You really put in the persepective how much we buy into capitalism to feel better about ourselves.

[Frank Meeuwsen - Global PSC Awareness Day and selfcare](https://diggingthedigital.com/global-psc-awareness-day-and-selfcare/)

* First, I like the multilingual approach created for this post. Thank you for sharing about Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and your experience living with this disease. I really enjoy the approach you take. With self-care you learn to see things in a positive light. I agree with "to rest more and consciously slow down."  This has been something I've been learning as well. It became unhealth and bad for mental health. Strecthing yourself thin is not feasible anymore. I appreciate you aspect on learning to take control of a situation. "I know I can affect it. I know now that I can change it." This resonates with me so much!  

[Jeremy Cherfasi - Self-care Success](https://www.jeremycherfas.net/blog/selfcare-success)

* I really your approach of enjoying the little and big things in life. I can agree that traveling has always been a way of self-care. A way to disconnect physically from the place one is based out of to a different environment. Self-care to you seems that you truly enjoy life and you genuinely enjoy the things you do such as biking, baking, etc. You wrote having "a sense of purpose and of mastery" is something I resonate with. I'm still trying to find my sense of purpose. I'm learning not to stretch myself thin an focus on the things I love. I love who you wish the drivers to take care of themselves

[Tracy Durnell - Extending my understanding of self-care](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/10/14/extending-my-understanding-of-self-care-indieweb-carnival-october-2023/)

* Right off the bat, your approach on the "bigger whole" is a like a piece of the puzzle or a train network. If any of it is missing, it simply doesn't work well. Community is so important. Unforntunately we live in a very individualistic society and we need community more than ever. "So much of self-care is treating the symptoms rather than the source, because the source is systemic." I didn't think about it this way. I recently started going to therapy and I thought the goal was to get to the get to the root of the problem while hitting the symptoms like a ping pong. Thank you for sharing the books you mentioned in your response. There are so many self-care books it's hard to find where to start. I'm trying to get to the right path. Oh man, this is hits hard: "Showing up for our friends better, sometimes that means showing up for ourselves, and sometimes itâ€™s shared." This makes me reflect, when I wasn't for there for myself, I wasn't there for my community in this case, my friends. If I wasn't  Self-care shows that you can care for yourself and for others. This has been a year of improvement but so much I still have to reach. Thank you for sharing this perspective on community and individuals. This opened my eyes in so many ways.

[Anthony Ciccarello - Creating space to feel my emotions](https://www.ciccarello.me/blog/2023/11/01/creating-space-to-feel-my-emotions/)

* I can relate so much with Anthony's response. Right away, the second sentence, "My natural inclination is to bury my own emotions to protect my relationships" is very similar to what I've felt over the years. All at my expense. Bottling it all up just wears a peson down. I've been very hesitant about sharing that I've been seeing a therapist and how I've started to open up a lot more to people on what's happening in life. I really appreciate your emphasis and approach on the word, *space*. A space can have so many purposes.  I've been learning how to use spaces inside and outside as more than being inside and outside. The space one uses can truly affect the outcomes of self-care. Spaces to think, spaces, to move, spaces to unwind, and a space to grow demonstrate healthy, safe, self-reflection and so much more. 

[Jo - Things to do offline](https://dead.garden/blog/things-to-do-offline.html)

* Jo does a great job at "kill[ing] two birds with one stone" by addressing the self-care prompt and a post I wrote on books. The response is amazing. I really like perspective on reading books. I don't discourage reading not matter the format. We live in a world where we have so many different mediums of reading. Reading away from anything that has a microchip of any kind is for me a form of reset. Just like you mentioned, sometimes the only way to get access to specific content is via digital means. Reading physical really helps reground and reconnect with the digital world. Having solo time and hanging out with people is great but a balance is necessary. You defintely don't want to go to far on the solo end or not having solo time and spending too much time with others. It's a preference in many aspects. I enjoyed your self-care activity list! I get lost with looking at vinyls at the record shop.

[CJ - Self-Care and Routine](https://ww0cj.radio/blog/2023/self-care-routine/)

* CJ has some great points on find things at are less "productive-feeling." For the longest time, doing things like watching Netflix or go to the movies, I felt that I was wasting time and I pushed these activities away. It's been hard just to disconnect from my obligations and I've come to the realizations that I need to sit my ass down and just relax. It's not necessary to be always engaged in things that are "productive." It's productive to let your mind engage in other things!
