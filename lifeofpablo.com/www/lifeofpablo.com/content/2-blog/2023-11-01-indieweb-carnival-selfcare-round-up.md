October is a wrap! ðŸŽƒ I hosted October's [IndieWeb Carnival on self-care](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/indieweb-carnival-october-2023). Thank you to everyone who participated in this month's IndieWeb Carnival topic. I appreciate all the responses I recieved. I recieved so many perspectives on the topic. I chose this theme as this is something I am working on improving for myself.

[Anthony Ciccarello - Creating space to feel my emotions](https://www.ciccarello.me/blog/2023/11/01/creating-space-to-feel-my-emotions/)

* I can relate so much with Anthony's response. Right away, the second sentence, "My natural inclination is to bury my own emotions to protect my relationships" is very similar to what I've felt over the years. All at my expense. Bottling it all up just wears a peson down. I've been very hesitant about sharing that I've been seeing a therapist and how I've started to open up a lot more to people on what's happening in life. I really appreciate your emphasis and approach on the word, *space*. A space can have so many purposes.  I've been learning how to use spaces inside and outside as more than being inside and outside. The space one uses can truly affect the outcomes of self-care. Spaces to think, spaces, to move, spaces to unwind, and a space to grow demonstrate healthy, safe, self-reflection and so much more. 

[Jo - Things to do offline](https://dead.garden/blog/things-to-do-offline.html)

* Jo does a great job at "kill[ing] two birds with one stone" by addressing the self-care prompt and a post I wrote on books. The response is amazing. I really like perspective on reading books. I don't discourage reading not matter the format. We live in a world where we have so many different mediums of reading. Reading away from anything that has a microchip of any kind is for me a form of reset. Just like you mentioned, sometimes the only way to get access to specific content is via digital means. Reading physical really helps reground and reconnect with the digital world. Having solo time and hanging out with people is great but a balance is necessary. You defintely don't want to go to far on the solo end or not having solo time and spending too much time with others. It's a preference in many aspects. I enjoyed your self-care activity list! I get lost with looking at vinyls at the record shop.

[CJ - Self-Care and Routine](https://ww0cj.radio/blog/2023/self-care-routine/)

* CJ has some great points on find things at are less "productive-feeling." For the longest time, doing things like watching Netflix or go to the movies, I felt that I was wasting time and I pushed these activities away. It's been hard just to disconnect from my obligations and I've come to the realizations that I need to sit my ass down and just relax. It's not necessary to be always engaged in things that are "productive." It's productive to let your mind engage in other things!
