The last 6 months or so, I've spent time with a person who is really special to me. Someone who has helped me learn so much about myself and has helped me learn so much about them. I have so many special memories. This person shared a lot of firsts with me. Especially being new to California. California is a new lifestyle to live.  We did new activities such as trying new sports or going places that have been dreams in my head. These activities became reality. I really enjoyed sharing these new experiences with you. We had so much fun together. I've been very happy. I got to support them in so many ways. I really care for this person. They will always have a special place in my heart.  I am an open minded person. I am willing to try and do very questionable things. I'm no saint. 

Things took a turn. The day you decided to go to the extreme and do that activity, it shattered my heart into a million pieces. I really didn't think you would do that.  I don't want you to go down this path or any other dark path. I'm always afraid that, "This was one time only." could lead to more bad decisions and negative consequences. This bad decision taken crosses every boundary I stand for.  I'm not judging you for doing this. I am simply angry at the decisions. 

I know you have to face a journey. You are not alone.  Just know, I will always be there to support you. You know how to contact me. 

Writing this is painful to do. All the memories are clashing with pain. I try to look past it by seeing the positive.

I will always love you. 

Right now, we can't be.,

Pablo
