I recently redesigned my website and let me tell you, It was long overdue. The redesign was on my to do list from a long time a go. Things were a mess in the code. It's still a work in progress.  I was using multiple style sheets (I'm still reducing this). I was using a theme I had modified and I was using *[Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/)*, a CSS framework. Having to add more CSS classes for specific purposes was getting overbearing. Sure my blog posts were getting pretty with various designs and looked a little nicer. I hate to say it, I was often more worried about what my website looked like instead of focusing more of the quality of my posts. An RSS reader simply pulls the content and none of the styling that comes with CSS classes. 

I was starting to lose it. I simply needed to strip my website of any unnecessary CSS and classes. I was also limited on time so I couldn't commit to something from scratch. I found a simple CSS framework that provided me the bare minimum that made my website look very simple but more put together. 

The name of the CSS framework is...wait for it... called, *[simple.css](https://simplecss.org/)*. It's a CSS framework that has no classes built in. Simply load this and boom! Your website is mostly organized without the "extra" stuff. It's super simple to override the CSS code to add something specific.

Using *simple.css* was good enough for me. Simply, it was a no brainer. It allowed me to address the issues, and it was good enough to implement. *simple.css* is simple and fast. At this time, I don't feel the need to commit to designing from scratch the CSS to make my site pretty. Going minimal is good enough for me. 

This is why 'Good Enough' is enough to get things done.
