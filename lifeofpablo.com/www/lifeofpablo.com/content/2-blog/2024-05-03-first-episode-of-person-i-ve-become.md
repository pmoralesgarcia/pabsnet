Announcement!!

I would like to share that I have posted the first episode of my new podcast, [Person I've Become](https://personivebecome.com/). [My first episode](https://personivebecome.com/episode-1-sammy/), I interview [Sammy Harper](https://www.sammyharper.com/), an environmentalist and green tech lover on how he's got to this point in his life and the person he's become. It has been exciting to start this new podcasting adventure and I will post more episodes soon! 

I hope you enjoy the first episode. Send me any comments or questions via email at hello@personivebecome.com. I'm actively looking for guests for the podcast. I'd love to have you!

**Here's a brief summary of the podcast.**  
Ever wonder how the person next door got to where they are? Each episode of The Person I've Become is an exploration of that very question. Host Pablo Morales sits down with everyday people as they navigate career changes, relationships, personal growth, and more. Join us for authentic conversations, raw emotions, and a deeper understanding of what it means to be The Person I've Become.
