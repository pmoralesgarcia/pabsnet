[James](https://jamesg.blog/) & [Pablo](https://lifeofpablo.com) at [Pinecrest Diner](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=pinecrest+diner&ia=web) in San Francisco.

I love meeting with friends at diners. This is especially true when I return to Nebraska. When I land, I'll go with the person who picked me up at the diner after midnight. Going to the diner is a fun adventure when it's snowing, raining, sunny, hot, chilly, or raining cats and dogs!

Diners are also places to meet people who have only met through a virtual medium such as video calls and online groups. Rarely do you meet people in real life (IRL) you get to converse weekly online.  

A few weeks ago in July, I met with [James G](https://jamesg.blog/). We both actively participate in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). (You should check it out!) James is a coffee lover and also enjoys writing. He was telling me about a [coffee mojito](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=coffee+mojito&ia=web). 

James mentioned a while ago that he was visiting San Francisco for work during [Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club). I was very excited to get a coffee and walk around the city. [San Francisco](https://pabs.lol/sf) is one of my favorite cities

You're wondering, "So you two are getting coffee and talking? What 'bout the diner?" Originally, getting coffee and chatting was the original plan. Then, I remembered that James loves diners and this got my brain juices flowing! WE SHOULD GO TO THE DINER! This is not a drill! I love a good side trip to spice up the adventure. Food and coffee unite people. 

I love food and getting caffeinated

Diners are lovely! James loves diners. I've never heard of someone loving diners as much as he does! It makes me very happy! 

We decided to eat at a fine establishment called the [Pinecrest Diner](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pinecrest-diner-san-francisco-2). This place is an institution in San Francisco! Imagine a traditional diner restaurant with yummy breakfast food but in SF! The food is so heavenly people wait in line. This place truly hits the spot. They make the food in front of you due to the openness of the space. 

While eating, we caught up and we discussed various topics of interest. We discussed our visions for our respective personal websites, our current projects, Mozilla, and things to do in San Francisco such as checking out [Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/). I also recommended [The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment ](https://www.themade.org/) in Oakland. I enjoyed the discussions and ideas bounced off each other. 


Thank you James for hanging out! I had a blast! 

I hope to see James when I'm on his side of the water. Should I see you at IndieWebCamp San Francisco?
