In response to James G on [Spotify Wrapped](https://jamesg.blog/2023/11/29/spotify-wrapped/) 

  I got the results my Apple Music Replay'23. I'm that person who doesn't use Spotify. I left Spotify a while ago and I forgot that Apple Music does something similar to Spotify Wrapped. I honestly didn't know that Apple Music had a feature to share. It was interesting because I had to launch my browser to get the Replay'23 instead of it being in app. It was easy to share on social media as images. My listens ranged from mid/late 2000s to more recent. I really liked listening to [The Submarines](https://thesubmarines.com/). I'm a sucker for the song [*Brightest Hour*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmy6m25gQho).

  This coming I would like to discover smaller indie bands and attend more concerts to get out of my cycle of repeating and getting too comfortable with the things I listen often. 

  I really like [Jo's Post](https://dead.garden/blog/my-spotify-wrapped--deadgarden-advent-calendar.html) on what she listened to on Spotify. I love what you listened to this year and how you organized your post!

I read [Henrique's Post] on what he listened to on Spotify. Het made me remember that I need to give my vinyls a little more love (or a spin) and decrease my listening minutes on my phone. 

I know I have an interesting taste in Music but I like listening to alternative. 

  Well here you go! Enjoy!
