I went ice skating for the first time in years. The last time I ice skated was back in Omaha. It's something I don't do often but I've been having an itch the last few years. Living in Downtown San Francisco, there's an Ice skating rink at Union Square that I pass by all the time. It's been one of those activities that I tell myself, "I need to do this before they tear it down!" I keep pondering everytime I pass it, then I forget because I have to get to my destination. 

This weekend, I finally did it! I went with my friend Tim, who was visiting for the weekend. Why not do something interesting with a friend? I was very happy that I went with my friend!  

My biggest achievement is I didn't fall on my face! I kept my balance.

The lesson I learned from this is to simply do something and not ponder it too late! I need to get into the habit of doing activities on my own (and make them into artist dates). I just got to do things and enjoy time with myself.
