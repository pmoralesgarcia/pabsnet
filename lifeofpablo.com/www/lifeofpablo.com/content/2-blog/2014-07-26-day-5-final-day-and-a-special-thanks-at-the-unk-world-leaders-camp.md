"Well today was the end of the great World Leaders Camp hosted at UNK.

I had breakfast Had some scrambled eggs, sausage and hash-brown with a cup of OJ. I was just pondering about what the day was to bring... Mixed feelings all around.

We had a Global Networking Lecture from Prof. Amundson. It was very amusing. I personally learned a lot. His point was to meet people and network. He said, "" Your best experiences are through networking."" I 100% agree on this quote. Study abroad is really something I would enjoy.

You can not end a great camp without a great game of Jeopardy. Man was my team being beat. Colin was just spitting out answers like no other. I was getting nervous.

Then we got our certificates

This is my first certificate in college. I hope for many more. I was happy when I got it.
