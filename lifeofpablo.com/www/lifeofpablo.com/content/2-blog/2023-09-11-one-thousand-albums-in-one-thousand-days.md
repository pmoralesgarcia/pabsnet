# Sunday Morning Adventure

It was a Sunday and I was simply looking for something to do on an afternoon. Yesterday, I went to the [bookstore](https://www.beersbooks.com/) yesterday in a long time. Going to the bookstore is a fun place to simply browse with no goal. You can simply just look and hope that something catches your eye. Oh boy! did a few things catch my eye! One book I really want to talk about is
*1000 Record Covers* by Michael Ors. Just as the title describes, it is a book showing different record covers. The book organized by decade (50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s). It's a simple book with an record covers and a information about the record album. I inititally hesitated in purchasing this book. Then, I started thinking about my taste in music. 

# Breaking The Loop

I've been stuck in this loop of music where I listen to the same stuff over and over and over again. It's been something I've been disatisfied with myself for a while. I purchased this book not just look at all the vintage record covers, I want to expand my taste in music. So I decided to challenge myself to break away from comfortability by listening to music I don't listen to normally or never thought to listen. 

I am using this book as a guide to find new music. Streaming services ideally make it easy to discover new music. At the same time it seems overwhelming and distracting to even know what to discover. A book helps provide content without other distractions popping out of every direction. I also want to learn more music history throught listening which will spark my curiosity even more. I want to be able to find more ways to connect myself and see the world differently through music. 




# The First Album

Today is Day One and we're starting at the 50's . I am listening to album [Let's Go Dancing To Rock And Roll](https://www.discogs.com/release/3479679-Hen-Gates-And-His-Gaters-Lets-Go-Dancing-To-Rock-And-Roll) by Hen Gates And His Gaters

So far, i've enjoyed it. It like the genre so far. We're off to a great start.

# Some limitations

Not everything will be on Apple Music as I found out with *Let's Go Dancing to Rock and Roll*. Youtube is my next solution. That involves me making a playlist since it hasn't been organized by someone else. I won't let this discourage me but it will be challenging at times.

# How long will this take?

I will share my progress in listening and what I have learned so far in future blog posts, at various cyles such as various intervals. Definetly will share at albums number 250, 500, 750 and of course at 1000. According to basic math, it will take me close to 2.75 years to complete this if I do one album a day. This could either go faster or slower depending the circumstances. 

# Build a microsite

I will create a web app or a static page that I update daily or every few days on what I am listening to from the book. It will take suggestions using webmentions and other forms of contact.

The link will come soon in an upate post.
