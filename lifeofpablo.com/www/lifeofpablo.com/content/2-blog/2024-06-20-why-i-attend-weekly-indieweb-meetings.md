Many dread attending video conferences due to their job or don't like it for some reason. I don't mind it for many reasons. Especially after the pandemic, the methods I use to interact with people have drastically changed. 

Attending online meetings is fun for me especially if I enjoy attending meetings on topics I enjoy! Attending anything IndieWeb-related via [Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club). Topics discussed are the IndieWeb technologies, technical solutions, receiving advice on building something, and more. Of course, the meetings are not always technical. One of my favorite things we do in Homebrew Website Club is showing off the changes we've done on our personal websites! I love it when someone shares that new feature on their site or that blog post that someone finally finished! It makes me happy that people are proud of their work!

We also share those articles we like or share that cool website with that cool font or the picture someone took today. The meetings are for everyone to share a topic that is interesting to them. The conversation possibilities are endless. I've received great advice from fellow IndieWeb members on how to do XYZ. I also love picking the brains of others on XYZ especially when it comes to my personal website. I am very grateful for this. Some days I don't participate as often but I'm always attentive to what I can learn from others. 

I always look forward to events beyond *Homebrew Website Club* meetings! These are something to look forward to! These events usually have a specific goal or topic in mind. For example, I love attending writing meet-ups for dedicated writing time. It helps provide a dedicated time to write a blog post that's been marinating in my drafts for a while. Maybe you get the inspiration to write something completely new. I also enjoy the *Build a Website in an Hour* event to create a new page on your personal website or launch a completely new website. The event ideas are infinite! It'd be nice to see more variations on events. My goal is to host an event soon! Stay tuned!

Everyone and anyone is welcome to attend these online events. You don't need to be part of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org). If you're curious about joining one of the events, just come hang out with us! You don't have to have a personal website or be tech-savy. We'd be happy to answer your questions! Attending these meetings is a great way to connect with people located on the other side of the world. Maybe you'll meet someone who lives in the same city as you?
