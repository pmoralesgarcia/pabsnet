I have witnessed some bad cooking in my life but my goodness my soul was questioning my own existence. Knowing the basics are important. I acknowledge that there are various approaches to make popular Mexican dishes but Rachel Ray's approaches is not good. There is so much missing and there is such a disconnect with the inteded cultural connections. Some things witnessed in this video are just plain wrong. I'm still shaking my head.

These review videos are everything I felt. The emotions I felt when from shocked to disbelief to me being angry at various degrees. I shared these emotions with the ladies in the video.
