*This post responds to my [blog post](deeper-level-questions-to-learn-about-people). I am answering [question #1](deeper-level-questions-to-learn-about-people#2)*

What motivates me to work hard? Now that's a good question!

What motivates me is trying to reach an end goal. In order to reach happiness, to reach financial stability, to find a direction for some sort of purpose. What motivates me to work hard is how I put in the energy to give it my all so the result feels that I accomplished something. 

I work hard due to my work ethic and the values I learned while growing up. How can I become equal to those around me and not be seen as less? Certain factors oblige me that I have to work harder for the things I aspire to reach. I am more than capable as those around me. Growing up, I knew things weren't going to be easy. 

I work hard so I can provide my parents with a better life. They did their best and I want to be able to help them as they are aging. I want to work hard to help them also enjoy life.

Am I doing enough? I'm not sure.
