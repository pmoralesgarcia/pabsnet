Description: Just my thoughts on this day
---
Went to bed late last night. I woke up really late for my first class but made it for the last ten minutes so I could mark my name down forâ€¯attendance. It was not too much of a bad day. I worked out since sociology was cancelled. ===redacted=== Almost fell asleep in chemistry. Went to work. It was just another day. I killed it during dinner back in the grilled. Went back to the dorm. I was all alone since everyone left for home. God I feel like a loner at the moment. Cleaned my room and packed everthing I needed for home so I can just load it up for tommorow.
