It was a Sunday and I was simply looking for something to do on an afternoon. Yesterday, I went to the [bookstore](https://www.beersbooks.com/) yesterday in a long time. Going to the bookstore is a fun place to simply browse with no goal. You can simply just look and hope that something catches your eye. Oh boy! did a few things catch my eye! One book I really want to talk about is
*1000 Record Covers* by Michael Ors. Just as the title describes, it is a book showing different record covers. I inititally hesitated in purchasing this book. Then, I started thinking about my taste in music. 

I've been stuck in this loop of music where I listen to the same stuff over and over and over again. It's been something I've been disatisfied with myself for a while.
