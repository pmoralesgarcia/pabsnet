It was a Sunday and I was simply looking for something to do on an afternoon. Yesterday, I went to the [bookstore](https://www.beersbooks.com/) yesterday in a long time. Going to the bookstore is a fun place to simply browse with no goal. You can simply just look and hope that something catches your eye. Oh boy! did a few things catch my eye! One book I really want to talk about is
*1000 Record Covers* by Michael Ors. Just as the title describes, it is a book showing different record covers.I inititally hesitated in purchasing this book. Then, I started thinking about my taste in music. 

I've been stuck in this loop of music where I listen to the same stuff over and over and over again. It's been something I've been disatisfied with myself for a while. I purchased this book not just look at all the vintage record covers, I want to expand my taste in music. So I decided to challenge myself to break away from comfortability by listening to music I don't listen to normally or never thought to listen. 

I am using this book as a guide to find new music. Streaming services ideally make it easy to discover new music. At the same time it seems overwhelming and distracting to even know what to discover. A book helps provide content without other distractions popping out of every direction. 

 The book organized by decade (50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s). 



Today is Day One. I am listening to album [Let's Go Dancing To Rock And Roll](https://www.discogs.com/release/3479679-Hen-Gates-And-His-Gaters-Lets-Go-Dancing-To-Rock-And-Roll) by Hen Gates And His Gaters
