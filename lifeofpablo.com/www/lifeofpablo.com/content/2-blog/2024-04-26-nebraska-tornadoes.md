My home state got hit pretty hard with tornadoes today. lots of people's homes were destroyed. my friends and family were giving me update. they are all okay. Things will get back to normal but will take time. im also worried with climate change, we will see these intense storms happen more often. 

thinking of my people in Nebraska
