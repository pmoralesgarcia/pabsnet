          Congrats to Tracy for celebrating 20 years of blogging! 

This really resonates with me as we are all finding a place to express ourselves.

> I struggled with self confidence and taking up space and feeling unheard — but the Internet is somewhere I always felt there was room for me. A personal website granted me permission to share what I made, since that was what everyone else was doing with their websites; joining a culture with self-publishing as an established norm was huge. Knowing my words are out there for others, whether or not anyone reads them, makes me feel like I’m part of the online community.

You have inspired so many and we are happy that you are part of this community.
