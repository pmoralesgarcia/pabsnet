Today, after many months I finally received a [Google IT Support Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support).  I am very happy. I learned so much from this course and revisited topics I knew already.  I definitely picked up some new skills for my current role.  The certificate had five courses ranging from basic networking to IT Security. I would say this was a well rounded course.  It really put in perspective various aspects of an IT Support Professional.  It was also a wake-up call! I have so much to learn still!!! 

Being in this role, you could be a generalist or a specialist. This depends on the role one gets. In my role and working with a small team of IT professionals, I find myself being a generalist but also specialized in specific things. 

I find it important is to keep learning in my career. I plan on taking more courses to get more certificates to gain more skills. I started a Google Cyber Security Course and a mathematics course. I'm going to try to balance three to five courses. I want to get in the routine of going back to school. I find this funny because I work at a school. By having this routine, I would like to start my Master's program this year. 

I'm really excited for what's to come this year! It'll definitely be a year of learning.
