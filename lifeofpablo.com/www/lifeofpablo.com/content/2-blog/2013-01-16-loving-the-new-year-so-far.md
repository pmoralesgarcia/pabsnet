I know what I said earlier that I was going to write on my blog daily...that never happened!! i will update it often. If you guys are wondering I had a great Christmas. Its already half way through the month and nobody probably cares. Well I got some Vans, some nice Khaki pants and $1000! Did i mention that I'm going to France?? Anyhow i enjoyed that i spent time with them. This year is going to be great. Nebraska weather is crazy because one day it is cold and the next it is sunny and warm. its crazy livin' the Nebraskan life.
