<h6>The Pain.. :(  :'(</h6>

So today i had surgery. On my nose to be exact.What a way to start summer.  I guess I have had a long term problem that after 18 some years finally got fixed. This was <strong>not</strong> a nose job, but intro-nasal procedure

Like any surgery it hurts like not other. With all the pains med, I feel loopy. I don't even know if anything im writing hear is making any sense....<strong> Sorry in advance.</strong> :P   The things that are going in my head right now.... You don't want to know.

What makes me really worried is that I have a college class on Monday and I'm going to show up to class like this. I don't know if i will be more scared with a gauze stuck to my face. This or even the fact that people will stare. Maybe I am worried about both.

<blockquote>WHO CARES!!!</blockquote>

I'll be like "what are you looking at?" I'll let you well you know what happens on Monday.

Wish me luck! I hope for a speedful recovery.
