So it has been a while since I've posted. :(

Today it hit me that I only have three days of school left. Most of us would say, ""I cant wait to get out those doors forever!"" but I on the other hand, I am actually sad :( about leaving high school. There have been so many great memories that I will be glad to look back on. So i got my cap and gown this week. Can not wait to walk down the stage and get my diploma. There is a new stage in life ready for me.Â I am excited to go to college next year.
