## Background Information

A few weeks ago I attended [Climate Week NYC](https://www.climateweeknyc.org/) in New York City. It was such a great time listening to all the great talks and participating in different activities such as driving a Lucid electric car with my friends. It got to meet such amazing people (and networked) who are in the climate change space. It made me step back an realize how much time we have lost not fighting the environment and how we only have a limited time to speed up on our actions. 

It was nice to be in a place full of public transportation and get my steps in. I was also wired on Matcha Lattes to keep up with the revolving door of events occuring all at once. 

## Getting Around to Building the Website

I've been meaning to build a website for a quick summary of my adventures in the city. I finally found the perfect day to do it. I finally was able attended a <a href="https://events.indieweb.org/2023/09/build-a-website-in-an-hour-IlkuPP6V6dNW" class="u-in-reply-to">Build a Website in an Hour</a> event. Thank you <a href="https://jamesg.blog/" class="u-reply-to">James G</a> for hosting this event! 

Just as the name of the event states, I built (most) of the website in an hour. It was fun and challenging because of the following:

1. I didn't have a plan on how this site was going to look
2. It was a challenge to get the site made in an hour. Talk about pressure
3. I got to hangout with people in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org).
4. Show off the adventures I went on.

## Where is this site located?

This website is located at https://climateweeknyc.lifeofpablo.com .

## Technologies Used
This website was made using vanilla HTML & CSS. I used [Tachyions](https://tachyons.io/) CSS Framework for the CSS.  I use it on my website, primarily on my blog, to change the appearance of my posts. I like this CSS framework because is it doesn't interfere with existing CSS frameworks or existing CSS stylesheets. The classes are easy to learn
