> 
> San Francisco transportation officials want to replace the "antiquated" infrastructure that uses floppy disks to run the Muni Metro light-rail system and awarded the first contract Tuesday for the roughly decadelong project.
> 
> The $700 million project to replace Muni Metro's train control system with a modern one would be its first upgrade in almost three decades. The city installed the current train control system in 1998, which requires loading three-and-a-half inch floppy disks each morning to operate the light-rail network.
