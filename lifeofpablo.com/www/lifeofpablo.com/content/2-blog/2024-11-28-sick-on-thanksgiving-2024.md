I'm lying on my couch in my San Francisco apartment trying to recover from the sickness I acquired. The last few days have been rough! Being sick is something I don't like to experience but here we are. 

Since I couldn't return to Nebraska this year for the holiday, I had plans to do a Friendsgiving. 

Everyone is enjoying themselves and having a grand old time.

It would be selfish of me to show up sick, and miserable, and risk getting people sick. I know people understand, but I don't like to disappoint others. 

I am grateful for a few things:

#### My Parents

Even though I couldn't return to Nebraska, I am very grateful for them. They have been very supportive in various aspects of life. I know they miss me and they wish I could move back. They love how I've branched off to live in a different place. I miss them a lot but I will see them soon!


#### My Friend Evan

My friend Evan was so kind enough for me to bring me crackers as I was struggling yesterday. He's a keeper! Those crackers brought me back to life. I'm so appreciative to have Evan in my life. 

Evan even walked me to McDonald's this morning making sure I got a light meal. McDonald's was closed. :( I just wanted two burritos. 

#### My Friends Sarah and Mike

My friend Sarah has been amazing over the years especially when I moved to Sacramento. She has helped me so much in getting used to California living and of course, having to put up with my shenanigans.

Mike is a great friend as well. He helped me guide my career to where it is now! He is a great person to have an amazing conversation with. I love talking about ethics with him and anything related to tech. 

I miss them both!

#### Alone Time

Being sick allowed me to do nothing, which is not bad. I ordered some soup in hopes of making me feel better sooner. I probably should watch a movie instead of doom-scrolling. I deserve to enjoy myself a little. Maybe I will code and work on my website and working on an API.

#### Homebrew Website Club

I am grateful I hung out remotely at [Homebrew Website Club](https://events.indieweb.org/2024/11/homebrew-website-club-pacific-n7kqQSz1oG6L) yesterday! I didn't participate as much as I wanted but I still made the effort to attend. There was some great conversation happening! Shoutout to [Tracy](https://tracydurnell.com/) and [Angelo](https://ragt.ag/) for hanging out and *tucking me in* virtually when I finally crashed.


Happy Holidays.
