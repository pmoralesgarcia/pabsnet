I'm really looking forward for the month of May! It will be a busy month but productive. 

Here's what's happening.

I'm entering my final year of my 20's. I'm going to make this a memorable year ahead. There are steps I would like to take before I hit the big 3-0. I'm not scared to enter 30. I want to learn to embrace it. 

I'm traveling to Germany this month for a green tech conference. I'm building a few arcade units to demo.

I'm hoping to start classes as I recently got accepted into a [master's program](i-got-accepted-to-a-master-s-program). I really want to teach at the university level.

Work on personal and work projects that have been on the back burner. I hope to reach these goals.

Continue working on the startup I'm working on with [Chris Wan](https://www.chriswan.me/). I'm hoping we can address few issues happening in education and to make learning more adaptable to all.

What are you excited for the month of May?
