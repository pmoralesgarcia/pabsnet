I have completed the System Administration and IT Infrastructure Services certificate from Google. I'm currently finishing up the Google IT Support. I have one more course that I have started. It is really satisfying to continue on and grow in my career. This year I would like to get as many certifications. I would like this year to be a year of learning. I want to also start my master's degree this year. I have decided to get a master's degree in Cyber Security. 

 Here's to a year of growth.  What do you have for growth for this year?
