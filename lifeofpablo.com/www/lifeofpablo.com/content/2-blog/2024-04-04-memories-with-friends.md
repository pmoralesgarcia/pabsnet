I've watched this video by [Luke Korns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oAlAfcqzF4) numerous times. Everytime, I watch it, it brings me joy thinking about my experiences traveling. Traveling is life changing and it's been life changing for me. It's taught me things, I wouldn't learn staying in one place. Learning about yourself is key for growth. Often, while learning we also learn from people. These people you learn from are strangers. I remember hanging out with strangers in Rome for an entire day. I've roamed around the city of Seoul, Korea with people I met on the bus. You get the idea. Meeting strangers is fun. 

I've learned so much from the people I've interacted on my travels. They've shown me their perspective on various topics and provided some life advice as well. All of these people have been strangers. I made a connection with them even if was sitting with them, eating lunch or spending the day with them. I saw their perspective of what it was like to grow up in their city. I've experience them providing a message to their city. It waa beautiful to witness them speaking in their native language.
