I've been a huge fan of BuzzFeed for many years for as long as I can remember. I remember stumbling on BuzzFeed's home page in the late 2000s. I've taken many of their quizzes posted on the site. There are other things on the site beyond the quizzes. 

I was very fortunate this week to visit BuzzFeed/Complex's office this week. I was very fortunate to get a tour and check things out! Going there was a whole experience. I got to share this experience with people I know an love. You know that feeling you get when you're a little kid at the grocery store eagerly waiting to see if my parents would buy me any candy. That's what I was feeling. I'm pretty sure I cried a few tears of joy. 

The office had such a cool color scheme and it went well with everything around it. It seemed very organized. I got to see how the office works and what the type of mood exists.  The space was a welcoming right when you walk into. I would say it is a pretty laid back office.It was everything I hoped and dreamed for. I was in heaven.

I can't say too much more other than, one more thing checked off my, "places I wan't to see some day."
