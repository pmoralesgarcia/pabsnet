>It was hot. I was sweating. We â€” were sweating. Had we ever sweat so much before? Did it matter? Our sweat had sweat. We were a moving swamp. The fabric bits on our backpacks had turned sentient. I wanted to apply bleach atop my sunscreen. Wanted to order replacement toenails. Because: we were walking. And by god, were we talking.

Such a great post! I felt like I  was visualizing what was all around Craig and his perspective of the walk. Talk about a good boy (dog) that followed them for most of their trip to their final destination. What a beautiful story. I hope to write like this with so much elegance and detail. The post even share the .kml file to map out in Google Earth.
