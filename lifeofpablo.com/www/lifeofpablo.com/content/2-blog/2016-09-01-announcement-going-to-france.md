"Dear Friends and family,

Today marks for an important announcement about my studies. Since many of you know, I have declared a French Education Major with an ESL endorsement very recently.  Everything is starting to look up. So time for the juicy part of my post. <strong>Hold on tight!</strong>

I would like to tell everyone that I will be studying abroad in France for this upcoming spring semester. Studying in France has been a dream that I have put on hold for quite some time. The desire to study in this country all began when I visited it over 3 years ago. That trip changed me greatly. This was the first time I had faced such culture.  Deep down, I knew deep down inside that this is where I would want to live for a portion of my life. Going there for 6 months will be the experience to see a new part of France that I have never been too. I will be at the Université de Strasbourg 'Institut International d'Etudes Françaises (IIEF UNISTRA).

Wanting to become French Teacher, this 6 month trip will greatly benefit me but most importantly, the influence I will have on my future students. I want to tell them what it is like living in another country. This trip will be a major milestone in my life as the want for has made me realize what I really want to do in my life. . As mentioned in a past post, I realized that teaching was actually my true calling. <em>Je suis contente! </em>Going through the process has been a lot of work. I am not even done yet, though! I still have to go to Chicago at some point in the semester to get my student visa. I will also get to see other parts of Europe! I am blessed to have such opportunity to explore outside of my comfort zone.

I only see good things happening. This is only the beginning. Again thank you for the support! I will keep you all updated!

Best Regards,

Pablo Morales"
