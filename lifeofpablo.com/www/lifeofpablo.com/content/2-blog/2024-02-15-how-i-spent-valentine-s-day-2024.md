      This year I actually enjoyed Valentine's Day. Most years are simply quiet and simply wishing the day is over it. Just like every other year, I spent it without a partner. It was a very eventful day ranging to eating sweets all day and going out on a Valentine's [Artist Date](reply-to-tracy-durnell-artist-dates). I went out to a local gay bar for some cheap drinks and to socialize with people who were probably there for the same thing. You know simply hanging out. I had some great conversation with some patrons. There was also trivia night as well. I didn't stay for it since I was hungry and I wanted to continue on the artist date. So I went to Kiki's Chicken Place for some chicken tender's and fries! I got a free pop (midwestern speak for soda) as well. I don't usually drink pop but I was like, "Live a little!" I also attended [Homebrew Website Club](https://events.indieweb.org/2024/02/homebrew-website-club-pacific-8XN2AGgxMoXH) off and on throughout the night. The remaining people stayed close to midnight.

            I attended the LGBT+ affinity group on campus which was so fun! Why was it fun? We created Valentine's Day Cards. It was so fun to catch up with people who I don't get to see regularly. Just hanging out with colleagues to take off the "work mask" and simply hangout!
