*This post is a response to my [blog post](deeper-level-questions-to-learn-about-people). I am answering [question #1](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/deeper-level-questions-to-learn-about-people#1): What is your definition of success?* 

For me, success comes in various parts. 

One of the greatest ways to find success is to first love yourself and being happy with where you are in life but always looking to grow. It comes down to whether you feel comfortable with yourself. Not feeling comfortable under your skin is truly the worst feeling ever.  I've felt this for a long time and it takes so long to feel better. Feeling better about yourself helps your outlook on life. 

Then everything else will fall into place. Remember you have been successful. 


Success is something that continues to evolve. You evolve.
