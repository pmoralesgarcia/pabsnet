I'm trying to figure myself out. I'm stuck in a rut. Nothing is helping. I'm stuck in a loop. I'm better some days. I'm worse off some days. So much of me lives in regret. So much of my past haunts me. I'm not happy with the person I'm becoming. I'm noticing a side of me I thought had I put behind me. All I can do is blame myself. I'm learning not to put all the blame on myself. 

Is that that reflection of me?

I'll try again.
