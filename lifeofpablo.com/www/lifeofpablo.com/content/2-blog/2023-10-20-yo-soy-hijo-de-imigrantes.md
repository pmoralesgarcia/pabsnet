          Perfect typography depends on perfect harmony between all of its elements. 
          Harmony is determined by relationships
          or proportions. Proportions are hidden everywhere. words themselves.

          True book design, therefore, is a matter of tact (tempo, rhythm,
          touch) alone. It flows from something rarely appreciated today:
          good taste. The book designer strives for perfection; yet every
          perfect thing lives somewhere in the neighborhood of dullness and
          is frequently mistaken for it by the insensitive. In a time that
          hungers for tangible novelties, dull perfection holds no
          advertising value at all.

          In a masterpiece of typography, the artist's signature has been
          eliminated. What some may praise as personal styles are in reality
          small and empty peculiarities, frequently damaging, that masquerade
          as innovations.

          Only through constant practice and strictest self-criticism may we
          develop a sense for a perfect piece of work. Unfortunately, most
          seem content with a middling performance. Careful spacing of words
          and the correct spacing of capital letters appear to be unknown or
          unimportant to some typesetters, yet for him who investigates, the
          correct rules are not difficult to discover.
