"Summer is officially started (for me at least.) I'm glad to be graduated from high school. Life is good. :)

Yesterday I went to sign up for classes at <a title="University of Nebraska at Kearney" href="http://unk.edu" target="_blank">UNK</a>Â . It was fun meeting new people at New Student Enrollment. All these people were nice. Well most of them. Some stood out more than others. The most exciting part was getting my school ID.

I don't know if I like it or not..... :P Its not like I liked my high school IDs either.

I am ready for college. Can't wait to room with my roommate. I just want to enjoy summer and make it unforgettable."
