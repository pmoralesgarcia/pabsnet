      Happy New Years! Today is a new day in a new year! I've been hanging out with friends and keeping it low key. I enjoyed how this day has gone so far.  I stayed up late and woke up late. It seemed like any normal day except it it's a holiday. I'm currently waiting at a train station to head home. Just a bit delayed but I will stay positive. It's too early to start being annoyed. Things happen and it's important I make it home safely.
      
       I have to prepare for tommorow as I am going back to work since being off for two weeks. I'm ready to get back in the routine of things. 

      I'm really excited to start 2024 and see the great things that will happen.
