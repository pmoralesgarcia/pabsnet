"<h2>Today is the day I've been waiting for... The UNK World Leaders Camp. I got to be one of 15 freshman students selected. I feel lucky to have this opportunity to be immersed with different world opportunities and other intercultural activities.</h2>

    <li>All-Expense Paid Camp to cover:
<ul>
    <li>On-campus lodging</li>
    <li>Three meals per day</li>
    <li>All transportation associated with the program</li>
    <li>Professional Intercultural Seminars</li>
    <li>Various International Activities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

I'm ready for the activities that are full of culture and art. I find different cultures fascinating, especially seeing differences to our own.

This will be my first activity as a UNK student. I'm actually excited to be on campus and get a head start where everything is located (I'll probably be lost anyways. So its worth a shot :) )

I'm excited to meet new people. People who have similar interests as me. Can't wait to meet my roommate for the next 5 days.

Wish me luck!

I'll post later tonight and will more as the week goes. Also i will update through social media. Go to my <a title=""Contact Page!"" href=""http://pabs.altervista.org/blog/pablo-on-social-networks/"">contact  page</a> to connect with me.
