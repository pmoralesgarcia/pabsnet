Life Update: I’m moving to Sacramento this summer.  

I’ve accepted a job in Sacramento. I’ve thought about moving in the past. I’m finally acting on it. I should enjoy my 20s living in a different place other than in Omaha. I have nothing holding me back except myself.

There’s a lot I’ve been learning. California will be my new place of learning.

I love my family and friends. I know they love me.

I’ll be around.
