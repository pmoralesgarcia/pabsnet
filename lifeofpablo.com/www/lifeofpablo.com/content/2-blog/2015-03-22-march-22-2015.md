Description: Just my thoughts on this day
---
I'm just glad to be home and get to be around those i feel comfortable. Mom maid me a big breakfast. I was so happy she did. I sort of just hanged around the house. I worked on my home computer trying to a â€¯server out of it. Forgot to go to church today. I guess I'll try next weekend. I need to get a lot of things off my back, things that are building up inside. The comes for a good confession. I've been happy for most of the day. I stayed busy most of the day so it kept me off of things. Went to the park and ran a good mile. It felt great!!! I was talking to my parents about me going to Mexico for part of the summer.
