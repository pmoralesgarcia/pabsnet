Thank you for your thoughts and the sharing of what you're reading/have read. It was very insightful. I appreciate your straight-forward approach. 

I respect you not having a smartphone and it really emphasizes using physical reading of various texts. 

I too also have a book with me I place in my bag but sometimes my backpack becomes a black hole where I forgot to look inside. 

That's pretty cool your job gives you a budget for reading. My current employer has us read a book during the summer but not a budget. I wonder how I can get a budget. I'll have to ask.

I remember you writing about your post on <a href="https://sarajaksa.eu/2023/09/i-need-to-get-rid-of-my-physical-books/" class="u-like-of">ridding yourself of physical books</a>. I'm in the same boat as you in some aspects.


Thank you again for your response! :D
