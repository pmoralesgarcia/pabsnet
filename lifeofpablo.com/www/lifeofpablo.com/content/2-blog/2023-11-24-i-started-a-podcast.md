Today at [IndieWeb Black Friday Create Day â€” Build Don't Buy](https://events.indieweb.org/2023/11/indieweb-black-friday-create-day-build-don-t-buy-P4ZVmtnyGR6v) event. I started working on a few projects. The most notable but easy one I did was create a podcast. It's called, [*Pablo's Thought Podcast*](/podcast). 

I'm going to talk about various topics from the IndieWeb to technology, self-care, blogging and things that interest me! The first episode is out! I hope to have guests and interviews on my podcast. Most of the time it will be me talking about a thought (a topic) I am interested in. This will be a weekly podcast.
