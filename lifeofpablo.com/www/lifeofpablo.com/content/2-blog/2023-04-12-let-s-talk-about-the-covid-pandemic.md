The COVID-19 is a virus that will always be on our minds as it is not simply going away anytime soon. It's an experience that will continue. The pandemic isn’t over. Period. The CDC announced the "[End of the Federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) Declaration](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/end-of-phe.html)" on May 11<sup>th</sup>, 2023.
I recently read a New York Times article, [Three Years Into Covid, We Still Don't Know How to Talk About It](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/22/magazine/covid-pandemic-oral-history.html).

The following phrase really got my gears workings, “Talking about this pandemic isn’t actually easy to talk about.” We know how we felt when we were in the height of the pandemic. As the article states, "Most people seem to feel great resistance to revisiting” conversations and experiences about the pandemic," which it is hard to put in words and the emotions revisited when trying to talk about it. Even as I write, which is the equivalent of having a conversation, I feel a sense of hesitation. I know that I need to have these conversations even if it is with myself. Most of the time when someone brings up the pandemic, it goes along the lines of, 

> " During lockdown, I learned ______."

> "I got caught up on my Netflix"

> "I bought a home"

Established at Columbia University in March 2020, [The NYC Covid-19 Oral History, Narrative and Memory Archive](https://incite.columbia.edu/covid19-oral-history-project), 200 individuals In New York were interviewed by an impromptu collective of sociologists and oral historians. The interviewed individuals shared their experiences as the pandemic unfolded. These same individuals were reinterviewed in waves about pandemic life from the spring of 2020 to the fall of 2022. They were asked what they were “seeing, doing and feeling and about what they expected, or feared, might happen next.” I really recommend looking into this project as the data in the archive will be released publicly by Columbia University  in the near future.

## I want to share my experiences

### Teaching

In 2019, I started my first year of teaching French. Being a first year teacher is difficult and exciting.  It was the hardest year in my employment history.  It was a very bumpy road of learning. I was teaching my favorite subject: le français! That is French by the way.

During Spring break we got the call that we were going to remote learning! So many questions at hand. Luckily for me, I had a lot of my material online already. I felt so bad for many colleagues as many struggled to wrap their minds around teaching remotely. So much information was thrown at us and information and procedures changed constantly. My goal was just to make sure my students were getting the best possible education in a remote setting.

I really worried about my students wondering if they were doing okay. Many hours were spent contacting families to make sure they were receiving the information they needed especially where English is not the primary spoken language. Many of these families are disadvantaged as communication doesn’t happen fast enough in their target language. I had to be a liaison to make sure their student was caught up or when the next device pick up day was and so forth and so forth. I had so many parents cry on the phone with me being so grateful that someone actually reached out because it seemed they were in the dark. It honestly broke my heart.

My worked payed off. I managed to have the highest attendance and highest engagement in my school building.

I volunteered to create a video message from my follow teacher colleagues to all the students at my school.

A  goodbye video was also created.

The second year of teaching was fine… We started out remote teaching then slowly made our way back in person.  

During my time in Omaha I went two full years without taking much time off for myself. Hell, I taught summer school two years in a row in a time when teachers were burnt out and no one really wanted to step foot at school during the summer. I don’t blame them. The last few years as a teacher has left us scarred in ways we don’t realize and our view of teaching has been forever warped by this pandemic.

March of 2020, I remember it was spring break

### Bought a Home

During COVID I made a huge financial decision. I bought a home! Hoo. Long term decisions were made. I honestly thought it was time to settle down in a bigger city (in comparison to my hometown, LOL) and set up my place of living.

### My move to California

Moving to California is a decision I should have made sooner.  I eventually transitioned into IT that I greatly enjoy.

### Trump Administration



### Death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg

This one hit hard for me

### Attacks on the LGBT communities

### Attacks and defunding of public schools


### Refocusing on skills
