I really enjoyed looking at your Music Monday posts! Those are pretty tight! 

What you wrote really resonates with me. I have a whole a crate of vinyls and a shelf with CDs that I need to take the dust off. I often feel that even thought they are right in front of me, I don't see them. 
> I am always interested in finding good new music, so that will be part of the goal, but I think this will also help me go through the catalog of albums I havenâ€™t listened to in ages and see how they hold up.

I can't wait to see what you are going to listen to  and share to on your site! Have a great weekend!
