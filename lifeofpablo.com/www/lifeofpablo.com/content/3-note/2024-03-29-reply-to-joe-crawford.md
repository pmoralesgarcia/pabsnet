> Pablo shared bravely this month. I have had the honor of having a fair number of people come out to me in the 1990s and I always felt honored when they shared that with me. And my ex-spouse as part of our slow-motion breakup learned a great deal about their own sexuality and I was always encouraging of them sorting out how they are and how they would like to live. People must be who they are. Iâ€™m proud of you Pablo!

Thank you so much for the very kind words Joe! This means so much!  I'm happier now that I'm living my more honest self. I appreciate you sharing the experiences you've had with other individuals too. It really warms my heart!
