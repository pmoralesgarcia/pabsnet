## Goal:
###I want to showcase my time in South Korea

I found out about this trip from the Foreign Language Specialist during my first year of Teaching with Omaha Public Public Schools. I figured, "Why not, I got nothing to lose?" I went through the process of interviewing. I was lucky and got chosen to be one of twelve teachers to go on this trip! 

It was a waiting game and exchange of emails from our leading professor. 

Then, the COVID-19 pandemic happened. Our trip was put on hold for two years.
